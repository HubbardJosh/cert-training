    question:
      "What is Comprehend Custom Entity Recognition and when is it needed?",
    options: [
      "An API that extracts entities from custom file formats like XML and CSV",
      "A feature that detects entities in custom programming languages",

    ],
    correctIndices: [2],
    explanation:
      "Built-in Comprehend NER detects standard entity types (Person, Location, Organization, Date). Custom Entity Recognition lets you train a model on annotated examples of your domain-specific entities — like internal part numbers, drug names, or proprietary identifiers — that the built-in model doesn't recognize.",

    correctIndices: [1],
    explanation:
      "Speaker diarization partitions a transcript into segments and assigns each segment a speaker label (Speaker 1, Speaker 2, etc.).

      "What is the DeepAR algorithm in Amazon Forecast and what distinguishes it from classical forecasting methods?",
    options: [
      "DeepAR is a rule-based forecasting method that applies exponential smoothing to each time series independently",
      "DeepAR is an ensemble method that averages ARIMA, ETS, and Prophet forecasts",
      "DeepAR is an LSTM-based algorithm that trains globally across many related time series simultaneously, learning shared patterns and handling cold-start better than per-series methods",
      "DeepAR uses reinforcement learning to adaptively update forecasts in real time",
    ],
    correctIndices: [2],
    explanation:
      "DeepAR trains a single LSTM model across all time series in the dataset, learning shared temporal patterns. This global approach performs better than training individual ARIMA or ETS models per series, especially when individual series have limited history.

      "Cold-start occurs when new users or items have no interaction history — Personalize falls back to popularity-based recommendations and uses metadata to find similar items",
      "Cold-start refers to API timeout errors when Personalize scales to zero — solved by keeping the campaign warm",
      "Cold-start refers to slow startup times for Personalize training jobs — solved by using Spot Instances",

    ],
    correctIndices: [0],
    explanation:
      "Cold-start is the inability to make personalized recommendations for new users or items due to lack of interaction history. For new users, Personalize defaults to popular items and personalizes rapidly as real-time events (via PutEvents) accumulate.

    correctIndices: [2],
    explanation:
      "Custom Terminology is a CSV or TMX file you provide to Translate containing source-term to target-term mappings.

    options: [
      "Precision measures training accuracy; recall measures test accuracy",
