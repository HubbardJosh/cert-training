      "AWS Site-to-Site VPN creates an encrypted IPsec tunnel between your on-premises network (using a customer gateway device) and your AWS VPC (through a virtual private gateway). It uses the public internet but encrypts all traffic. Direct Connect is a private, dedicated line — faster and more consistent but costlier.",

    question:
      "The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) organizes guidance into six perspectives. Which perspective focuses on aligning IT strategy with business strategy?",
    options: [
      "Platform Perspective",
      "Business Perspective",
      "Operations Perspective",
      "Governance Perspective",
    ],
    correctIndices: [1],
    explanation:
      "The Business Perspective of the AWS CAF focuses on ensuring that IT aligns with and supports business needs. It helps stakeholders understand how cloud adoption creates business value. Key capabilities include IT Finance, IT Strategy, Benefits Realization, and Business Risk Management.",

    question:
      "Which of the following are AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) best practices? (Choose TWO)",
    options: [
      "Grant maximum permissions and restrict later as needed",
      "Enable MFA for privileged IAM users and the root account",
      "Share IAM credentials between developers for convenience",
      "Use IAM roles for applications running on EC2",
      "Store IAM access keys in application source code for easy access",
    ],
    correctIndices: [1, 3],
    explanation:
      "IAM best practices include: enabling MFA for all privileged users and root; using IAM roles (not users) for EC2 and other services; granting least privilege (not maximum); and never sharing credentials. Roles use temporary credentials — more secure than long-lived access keys.",

    service: "AWS Cost Optimization",
    domain: "deployment",
    difficulty: "hard",
    type: "multi",
    question:
      "A company wants to reduce AWS costs. Which of the following actions would MOST likely reduce their bill? (Choose TWO)",
    options: [
      "Switch EC2 On-Demand instances running 24/7 to Reserved Instances with a 1-year commitment",
      "Enable Multi-AZ for all RDS databases",
      "Purchase Savings Plans for predictable compute workloads",
      "Enable CloudTrail logging in all regions",
      "Enable VPC Flow Logs for all subnets",
    ],
    correctIndices: [0, 2],
    explanation:
      "Reserved Instances and Savings Plans provide significant discounts (up to 72%) over On-Demand pricing for predictable workloads. Multi-AZ increases costs (you pay for the standby replica). CloudTrail logging incurs storage costs. For cost reduction, commit to predictable usage via RIs or Savings Plans.",
