  intro:
    "S3 is an object storage service offering 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability. Objects are stored in buckets and accessed via HTTP/HTTPS. S3 is the foundation for data lakes, static websites, backups, and application artifact storage.",

  sections: [
    {
      heading: "Core Concepts",
      body: `S3's data model is simpler than a filesystem: there are **buckets** (globally named containers tied to a specific region) and **objects** (the data itself, identified by a key). A bucket can hold an unlimited number of objects, and there is no real hierarchy — the "folder" structure you see in the S3 console is a visual representation of key prefixes (slashes in key names like \`images/profile/user123.jpg\`). Underneath, every object sits in a flat namespace within its bucket.

Each **object** consists of the data payload and associated metadata. Objects are immutable — you don't modify them in place, you replace them. The maximum object size is 5 TB, and objects can be as small as 0 bytes. The **key** is the object's full identifier within the bucket and is what determines partitioning for storage performance. S3 automatically distributes objects across multiple storage partitions based on key prefixes, providing at least 3,500 PUT/COPY/DELETE requests and 5,500 GET/HEAD requests per second per prefix.

An important consistency change happened in December 2020: S3 now provides **strong read-after-write consistency** for all operations. New objects are immediately readable after a successful PUT. Overwrites and deletes are also strongly consistent — a subsequent GET after a DELETE will never return the deleted object. This eliminates the class of bugs where applications read stale data immediately after writing, and you no longer need to design around eventual consistency for S3.`,

      heading: "Storage Classes",
      body: `S3's storage classes let you trade access speed and availability against storage cost. The right class depends on how frequently and how quickly you need to retrieve each object.

**S3 Standard** is the default: 99.99% availability, three-or-more AZ replication, no retrieval fee, and no minimum storage duration. It's the most expensive per GB stored and is appropriate for actively accessed data. **S3 Standard-IA** (Infrequent Access) cuts the storage cost significantly but adds a per-GB retrieval fee and a 30-day minimum storage duration — economical for data accessed less than once a month, but counterproductive if you retrieve frequently. **S3 One Zone-IA** stores data in a single AZ, saving an additional 20% over Standard-IA, but the data is lost if the AZ is destroyed — only appropriate for reproducible data like thumbnail images or intermediate results.

The Glacier tier exists for archival at very low storage cost. **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval** provides millisecond access (like Standard-IA) at lower storage cost, with a 90-day minimum. **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** is for true archival where you accept retrieval times of minutes to hours — Expedited (1–5 min), Standard (3–5 hr), or Bulk (5–12 hr) — with a 90-day minimum. **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** is the cheapest tier: 12-hour Standard retrieval, 48-hour Bulk, and a 180-day minimum. Use it for regulatory compliance archives you might never read.

**S3 Intelligent-Tiering** removes the access-pattern guesswork by automatically moving objects between tiers based on actual access patterns, charging a small per-object monitoring fee in exchange. It's the right choice when you genuinely don't know or can't predict which objects will be accessed and how often.`,

**Transition actions** move objects to a cheaper storage class after a specified number of days. A common pattern for log files moves them from Standard to Standard-IA after 30 days, then to Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 90 days, and finally to Deep Archive after a year. The policy handles this automatically — you configure it once and it runs indefinitely.

**Expiration actions** permanently delete objects after a specified number of days, which is important for controlling costs over time. A particularly useful expiration type is aborting incomplete multipart uploads: if a client starts a multipart upload but never completes it, the uploaded parts consume storage and incur charges even though no complete object exists. A lifecycle rule aborting incomplete multipart uploads after 7 days eliminates this cost accumulation automatically.

Policies can be scoped to the entire bucket or filtered by key prefix and object tags, giving you granular control. A single bucket can have multiple lifecycle rules with different conditions, making it straightforward to manage objects with different retention requirements in the same bucket.`,

      heading: "Upload Patterns",
      body: `Choosing the right upload mechanism matters for both reliability and performance, especially as object sizes grow.

**Single-part PUT** works for objects up to 5 GB and is simple to implement — one API call, one network transfer. The downside is that if the transfer fails, you must restart from the beginning.

**Multipart Upload** splits the object into parts (minimum 5 MB per part, except the last), uploads each part independently, and then sends a complete request that tells S3 to assemble them. This is recommended for objects over 100 MB and required for objects over 5 GB. The key advantage is resilience: if any individual part fails, you retry only that part, not the entire object. Parts can also upload in parallel, significantly reducing total upload time for large files. S3 keeps up to 10,000 parts per upload. Incomplete multipart uploads — where the upload started but the complete request was never sent — accumulate storage charges, so a lifecycle rule to abort them after 7 days is a best practice.

**S3 Transfer Acceleration** routes upload traffic through CloudFront's edge locations and the AWS backbone network rather than the public internet. This improves upload speeds for cross-continental transfers where the public internet path is congested or has high latency. You pay an additional per-GB fee and use the \`*.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com\` endpoint.

**Presigned URLs** grant time-limited access to a specific object — either for downloading (GET) or uploading (PUT) — using the credentials of the URL creator. Generated server-side and shared with clients, they let users upload directly to S3 without your application server proxying the upload. The URL expires based on the creator's session: up to 7 days for IAM users, and up to the role session duration for IAM roles (which can be shorter than 7 days).

\`\`\`typescript
import { S3Client, PutObjectCommand, GetObjectCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";
import { getSignedUrl } from "@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner";

const s3 = new S3Client({ region: "us-east-1" });

// Generate a presigned PUT URL — client uploads directly to S3
const uploadUrl = await getSignedUrl(
  s3,
  new PutObjectCommand({ Bucket: "my-bucket", Key: \`uploads/\${userId}/photo.jpg\` }),

      heading: "Access Control",
      body: `S3 has multiple layers of access control that interact with each other, and understanding their precedence is important for both security and the exam.

**Block Public Access** is the master override — four settings that prevent any public access to the bucket, regardless of what other policies or ACLs might say. It can be set at the account level (blocking public access across all buckets) or per bucket. AWS now enables all four settings by default for new buckets, and enabling Block Public Access at the account level is the most effective way to prevent accidental public exposure. It overrides both bucket policies and ACLs.

**Bucket Policies** are resource-based IAM policies attached to the bucket. They're the recommended way to grant access because they support the full IAM policy language: conditions, principal matching, resource ARN patterns, and cross-account grants. A common use is restricting access to a specific VPC endpoint (using the \`aws:SourceVpce\` condition) or granting another account read access to specific prefixes.

  ]
}
\`\`\`

**ACLs** are a legacy mechanism for per-object and per-bucket access control that predate bucket policies. AWS recommends disabling ACLs by setting Object Ownership to \`BucketOwnerEnforced\` — new buckets default to this. With ACLs disabled, the bucket owner owns all objects (even those uploaded by other accounts), which simplifies access management.

**S3 Access Points** create named endpoints with their own access policies, useful for large shared data sets where multiple teams need different access permissions. An access point for the analytics team can allow broad read access while an access point for the application team restricts reads to a specific prefix. VPC access points further restrict access to traffic originating from a specific VPC.`,

    {
      heading: "Encryption",
      body: `S3 offers encryption at rest through four mechanisms that differ in who controls the key material and how the encryption is performed.

**SSE-S3** is the default encryption option. S3 encrypts each object with AES-256 using a key that S3 manages entirely. You pay nothing extra for SSE-S3, and it requires no configuration on the client side — either set it as the bucket default or pass the \`x-amz-server-side-encryption: AES256\` header on PUT requests. This is appropriate for most workloads where you need encryption at rest but don't need visibility into or control over the key.

**SSE-KMS** uses a KMS key (AWS managed or customer managed) to protect the data encryption key. This adds several capabilities over SSE-S3: every encrypt and decrypt operation is logged in CloudTrail, you can control who can access the key via key policies, and you can rotate the key. The tradeoff is cost and throughput: every S3 GET or PUT against a SSE-KMS object makes a KMS API call, which counts against your KMS request quota and adds per-call cost. S3 Bucket Keys address this by generating a short-lived bucket-level key in S3 that reduces KMS calls by up to 99%.

**SSE-C** transfers the key management responsibility entirely to the client. You provide the encryption key on every request, S3 uses it to encrypt or decrypt, and then discards it — S3 never stores the key. Every request must use HTTPS and include the key material. **Client-Side Encryption** means you encrypt the data before it ever reaches S3 and decrypt it after downloading — S3 stores opaque bytes and cannot access the data at all. Encryption in transit is always available via HTTPS, and you can enforce HTTPS-only access with a bucket policy that denies requests where \`aws:SecureTransport\` is false.`,

      heading: "Versioning & Replication",
      body: `Versioning and replication are two independent features that together give you a comprehensive data protection strategy.

**Versioning** keeps every version of an object, creating a full history of changes. Once enabled on a bucket, versioning cannot be fully disabled — only suspended, which stops creating new versions but preserves existing ones. When you delete a versioned object, S3 adds a **delete marker** rather than removing the data. The previous versions remain accessible by specifying their version ID. To recover from an accidental delete, you delete the delete marker; to recover a specific previous version, you copy it to make it current. Versioning has a cost: you pay for storage of every version, including old ones. **MFA Delete** adds an extra layer of protection by requiring multi-factor authentication to permanently delete versions or change versioning state, protecting against both accidental and malicious deletion.

**Cross-Region Replication (CRR)** asynchronously copies objects from a source bucket to a destination bucket in a different region. Both buckets must have versioning enabled. The primary uses are disaster recovery (a separate region has a copy), compliance with data residency requirements, or latency reduction for users in the destination region. **Same-Region Replication (SRR)** does the same within a single region, useful for aggregating logs from multiple source buckets or maintaining a synchronized copy in a different account for separation of concerns.

An important limitation: replication only applies to new objects created after the rule is configured. Existing objects are not replicated retroactively — you must use S3 Batch Operations to copy existing objects to the destination if you need to replicate historical data. Replication rules can filter by prefix or tag and optionally change the storage class during replication.`,

You can configure rules that filter by prefix or suffix to narrow notifications to specific object patterns.

S3 can deliver notifications directly to three targets — SQS, SNS, and Lambda — or to **EventBridge**. Direct delivery to Lambda is the simplest path for triggering processing on uploads. SNS enables fan-out where multiple systems respond to the same upload event. SQS adds durability and backpressure: if the processor is slow, events queue up rather than being dropped. EventBridge is the most flexible option: it supports richer content-based filtering, routing to over 20 target types, cross-account delivery, and event archiving and replay.

An important operational characteristic: S3 event notifications are delivered **at least once**, not exactly once.

Enable static website hosting on the bucket, set an index document (\`index.html\`) and an optional error document, and S3 exposes a website endpoint at \`bucket-name.s3-website-region.amazonaws.com\`. Direct S3 website hosting requires the bucket to allow public reads, which means disabling Block Public Access — not ideal for production workloads where you want more control.

The recommended production pattern is **CloudFront + S3 with Origin Access Control (OAC)**. CloudFront serves content from edge locations worldwide, reducing latency for users regardless of their location. OAC configures the S3 bucket to accept requests only from your CloudFront distribution — the bucket has no public read access and cannot be accessed directly by users, only through CloudFront. This gives you HTTPS with a custom domain, WAF integration, Lambda@Edge for request manipulation, and caching at the edge, all while keeping the origin bucket private.

For data analytics use cases, S3 pairs naturally with **Amazon Athena**, which provides serverless SQL queries against data stored in S3. Partitioning your data by date, region, or other dimensions in the key prefix (for example, \`year=2024/month=08/day=15/\`) allows Athena to skip partitions that don't match your query, dramatically reducing the amount of data scanned and lowering cost. Storing data in columnar formats like Parquet or ORC — which Firehose can convert to automatically — yields additional cost reductions of 70–90% compared to JSON or CSV.`,

      body: `**S3 + Lambda** is the most common event-driven pattern for S3: an object upload triggers a Lambda function that processes the file — resizing an image, parsing a CSV, scanning for malware, or extracting metadata. The Lambda function receives the bucket name and key in the event payload and uses the SDK to read the object. For client-side uploads, presigned URLs let users upload directly to S3 without routing the file through your application server, which saves bandwidth and compute cost.

**S3 + CloudFront** is the standard CDN pattern for static content and websites. OAC restricts bucket access to CloudFront only, and CloudFront handles caching, HTTPS, custom domains, and geographic distribution. For high-traffic assets, the combination delivers dramatically better performance and lower origin cost than serving from S3 directly.

**S3 + Athena** (often with AWS Glue for schema management) enables ad-hoc analytics on large data sets without running a database or ETL pipeline. Glue crawlers can infer schema from S3 data automatically, and Athena queries it with standard SQL. This is the foundation of the serverless data lake pattern.

**S3 + CodePipeline and CodeBuild** makes S3 the artifact store for CI/CD pipelines — source code bundles, build outputs, and deployment artifacts all flow through S3 between pipeline stages. **S3 + Elastic Beanstalk** works the same way: Beanstalk stores application version bundles in S3 and deploys from there. **S3 + SageMaker** stores training data sets and model artifacts — SageMaker reads training data directly from S3, making S3 the natural staging area for machine learning workflows.`,
