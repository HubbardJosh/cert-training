      body: `SQS offers two queue types that serve fundamentally different use cases. **Standard queues** are designed for maximum throughput — they have no explicit throughput cap and scale to handle virtually any message volume, making them the right choice when raw speed matters more than perfect ordering. The tradeoff is that Standard queues guarantee **at-least-once delivery**, meaning a message may occasionally be delivered more than once due to the distributed nature of the service. Your consumers must be idempotent — processing the same message twice should have no harmful side effect.

**FIFO queues** trade throughput for correctness. They guarantee exactly-once processing by deduplicating messages within a 5-minute window using a \`MessageDeduplicationId\`, and they deliver messages in strict first-in, first-out order within a **MessageGroupId**. This makes FIFO the right choice for financial transactions, order processing, or any workflow where sequence and uniqueness are critical. The default throughput is 300 API calls per second (or 3,000 with batching); enable **High Throughput FIFO mode** for higher limits. Queue names must end in \`.fifo\`.`,

When your data exceeds that limit, the standard approach is to store the content in S3 and send the S3 key as the message body, using the extended client library to manage this transparently.

For FIFO queues, two additional attributes become critical. The **MessageGroupId** groups related messages that must be processed in order — all messages in the same group are processed sequentially and delivered to a single consumer at a time. The **MessageDeduplicationId** prevents duplicate processing: if you send two messages with the same ID within a 5-minute window, the second is silently discarded. You can generate this ID explicitly or let SQS compute it automatically as a SHA-256 hash of the message body.

**MessageAttributes** let you attach typed metadata (String, Number, or Binary values, up to 10 per message) without embedding it in the body — useful for routing decisions and filtering. The **DelaySeconds** attribute postpones delivery of an individual message by up to 900 seconds, overriding the queue's default delay setting.`,

The consumer must process the message and delete it before the timeout expires, or the message becomes visible again and another consumer may pick it up. This is the mechanism that prevents two consumers from processing the same message simultaneously, but it also means duplicate processing is possible if your consumer crashes mid-work.

The default visibility timeout is **30 seconds**, and the maximum is 12 hours. You set it at the queue level, but you can also override it per-message at the time of receipt. If processing is taking longer than expected, you can call \`ChangeMessageVisibility\` to extend the timeout before it expires — this is essential for long-running tasks.

When integrating with Lambda, set the queue's visibility timeout to at least **6× the Lambda function timeout**. Lambda may retry an invocation up to 3 times on throttle before returning the message to the queue, and if the visibility timeout is too short, the message becomes visible before Lambda finishes, causing a duplicate delivery. Always design your message processors to be idempotent — assume a message may be processed more than once.`,

The DLQ must be the same type as its source — a Standard source needs a Standard DLQ, and a FIFO source needs a FIFO DLQ. You should also set the DLQ's retention period longer than the source queue's retention period, giving you enough time to inspect failed messages after fixing the underlying bug.

Once you've corrected the processing logic, you can replay failed messages back to the source queue using the **DLQ Redrive** feature (available in the console or via the \`StartMessageMoveTask\` API). For monitoring, create a CloudWatch alarm on the DLQ's \`ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible\` metric so you're notified the moment messages start failing.

**Long polling** is almost always the better choice. By setting \`WaitTimeSeconds\` to up to 20 seconds, SQS will hold the connection open and wait until messages are available before responding. This eliminates empty responses, reduces the total number of API calls, and lowers your bill. You can enable long polling at the queue level via \`ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds\`, or per-request. Lambda event source mappings use long polling internally.

For throughput, always use batching. A single \`ReceiveMessage\` call can return up to 10 messages, and \`DeleteMessageBatch\` can delete 10 messages in one API call. When Lambda processes SQS, it can handle up to 10,000 messages per batch (configurable), making batch processing essential at scale.`,

The partial batch failure pattern is important to understand. Without it, if any message in a batch fails, the entire batch returns to the queue and every message gets retried — including ones that succeeded. With \`ReportBatchItemFailures\`, your Lambda function returns a list of failed message IDs, and SQS only retries those specific messages. The successfully processed ones are deleted. This prevents unnecessary reprocessing at scale.

      body: `The most important SQS integration pattern is **fan-out**: an SNS topic delivers a copy of each message to multiple SQS queues simultaneously. Each queue gets every message, and each downstream consumer operates independently — processing at its own pace, with its own DLQ and retry settings. This decouples a single publisher from multiple consumers without them knowing about each other.

For worker-based architectures, EC2 or ECS workers poll SQS for tasks and scale with Auto Scaling based on the \`ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible\` metric. This is the classic work-queue pattern — the queue absorbs traffic spikes while workers drain it at a controlled rate.

SQS also integrates directly with API Gateway using an AWS Service integration. API Gateway writes the client's request directly to an SQS queue and returns HTTP 200 immediately, while the backend processes the message asynchronously. This is useful for accepting high-volume writes without blocking the HTTP connection. EventBridge Pipes can use SQS as a source, applying filtering and enrichment before delivering to a target — a code-free alternative to a polling Lambda.`,
