## Installation & Local Development

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or later
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/more/expo-cli/) — install globally if not already present:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

### Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/aws-training.git
cd aws-training
npm install
```

### Start the development server

```bash
npm start
```

This opens the Expo dev server. From there you can:

- Press `i` to open in the iOS Simulator (requires Xcode on macOS)
- Press `a` to open in the Android Emulator (requires Android Studio)
- Press `w` to open in a browser (React Native Web)
- Scan the QR code with the **Expo Go** app on your physical device

---

## Installing on Your Device (No App Store Required)

### Option 1 — Expo Go (quickest, development builds only)

1. Install **Expo Go** from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779) (iOS) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) (Android).
2. Run `npm start` in the project directory.
3. Scan the QR code shown in your terminal with the Expo Go app (Android) or your Camera app (iOS).
4. The app loads instantly — no build step required.

> **Note:** Expo Go works great for development and personal use. The app runs inside the Expo Go container rather than as a standalone app on your home screen.

### Option 2 — Standalone build via EAS (installs as a real app)

This produces a native `.ipa` (iOS) or `.apk`/`.aab` (Android) that installs directly on your device like any other app.

1. Install EAS CLI:

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

2. Log in to your Expo account (create one free at expo.dev if needed):

```bash
eas login
```

3. Configure the build (first time only):

```bash
eas build:configure
```

4. Build for your platform:

```bash
# iOS (requires Apple Developer account for device distribution)
eas build --platform ios --profile preview

# Android (generates a shareable .apk)
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

5. Once the build completes, EAS provides a QR code or download link. On Android, open the link on your device and install the `.apk`. On iOS, the build can be installed via TestFlight or by registering your device's UDID in your Apple Developer account.

### Option 3 — Local iOS build (macOS + Xcode only)

```bash
npx expo run:ios
```

This compiles and installs the app directly to a connected iPhone or the iOS Simulator without going through EAS.

### Option 4 — Local Android build (requires Android Studio)

```bash
npx expo run:android
```

Compiles and installs directly to a connected Android device or emulator.
