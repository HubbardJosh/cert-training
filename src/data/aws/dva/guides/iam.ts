      body: `IAM is built around four fundamental entities. **Users** are long-term identities representing individual humans or service accounts. They authenticate with a password (for console access) or access keys (for API access), and because those credentials are permanent, you should prefer roles over long-term access keys whenever possible.

**Groups** are collections of users that share the same policies. Attaching a policy to a group propagates it to every member, which makes managing permissions at scale much easier than attaching policies individually. Groups cannot be nested, and they cannot appear as principals in resource-based policies — they're purely an administrative convenience for identity-based policies.

**Roles** are the recommended way to grant permissions to applications and AWS services. Unlike users, roles don't have permanent credentials — they issue **temporary credentials via STS** that expire automatically. EC2 instance profiles, Lambda execution roles, and ECS task roles all use this model, eliminating the need to store long-term access keys anywhere.

**Policies** are JSON documents that define what actions are allowed or denied on which resources. They're attached to users, groups, or roles. The **principal** in any IAM context is the entity making the request — a user, role, AWS service, or federated identity.`,

      heading: "Policy Types",
      body: `IAM supports several policy types, each serving a distinct purpose.

**Identity-based policies** are attached to users, groups, or roles and define what that identity can do. AWS provides **AWS Managed Policies** that it creates and updates as services change — these are convenient but broad. **Customer Managed Policies** are policies you create and control, with version history. **Inline policies** are embedded directly in a single user, group, or role — they're deleted when the principal is deleted and can't be reused, so they're only appropriate when you need a strict one-to-one binding.

**Resource-based policies** are attached to resources like S3 buckets, SQS queues, Lambda functions, and KMS keys. They specify which principals can perform which actions on that resource. Unlike identity-based policies, resource-based policies can grant cross-account access without requiring the external principal to have a matching identity policy.

**Permission boundaries** are a guardrail mechanism — they define the *maximum* permissions an identity can have, not the permissions they actually have. A developer's permission boundary might allow only S3 and Lambda actions; even if their identity policy grants DynamoDB access, the boundary blocks it. This makes it safe to delegate IAM creation to developers, because they can't grant themselves more access than their boundary allows.

**Session policies** are passed at the moment of role assumption or federation. They further restrict what the temporary session can do, without changing the role's underlying policies. **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** in AWS Organizations operate at the account level, setting the maximum permissions available to any identity in the account — except the management account root user.`,

      heading: "Policy Evaluation Logic",
      body: `When AWS evaluates whether to allow a request, it processes all applicable policies in a specific order. Understanding this order is essential for debugging access issues.

The evaluation starts by checking for an **explicit Deny** across all applicable policies. An explicit deny always wins — no Allow in any policy can override it. Next, if the account is in an AWS Organization, **SCPs** must permit the action, or the request is denied. For same-account requests, an explicit Allow in a **resource-based policy** grants access. If a **permission boundary** applies, it must also permit the action. **Session policies**, if present, must permit the action. Finally, an explicit Allow in an **identity-based policy** grants access.

If none of the above results in an explicit Allow, the default outcome is an **implicit Deny**. The rule of thumb: without an explicit Allow somewhere in the chain, access is denied.

One subtlety worth understanding is \`NotAction\`. Using \`Effect: Allow\` with \`NotAction\` allows everything *except* the listed actions — but it's not a deny. Other policies can still explicitly allow those actions. This differs from using \`Effect: Deny\` with \`Action\`, which creates a true deny that no Allow can override. For cross-account access, both the identity policy in the source account *and* the resource policy in the target account must allow the action.`,

Wildcards let you express broad permissions concisely — \`s3:*\` grants all S3 actions, and \`arn:aws:s3:::bucket/*\` matches every object in a bucket. **Policy variables** let you write dynamic policies that adapt to the caller's identity: \`\${aws:username}\` resolves to the calling user's name, and \`\${aws:PrincipalTag/team}\` resolves to a tag on the principal. This is the foundation of **attribute-based access control (ABAC)**, where a single policy governs access for many users based on their attributes rather than requiring per-user policies.

The \`Condition\` block supports over 40 operators and condition keys. Commonly used keys include \`aws:RequestedRegion\`, \`aws:SourceIp\`, \`aws:SecureTransport\` (enforce HTTPS), \`aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\`, and service-specific keys like \`s3:prefix\` and \`kms:ViaService\`.`,

All subsequent API calls use these temporary credentials.

Every role has a **trust policy** — a resource-based policy on the role itself that specifies who is allowed to assume it. The trust policy is what makes a role assumable. For an EC2 instance to use a role, the trust policy must trust the EC2 service.

In practice, you tag a role with \`team: payments\`, tag a DynamoDB table with \`team: payments\`, and write a policy with a condition that compares these tags:

Now any principal tagged \`payments\` automatically has access to any resource tagged \`payments\`, and access is automatically revoked if either tag changes. This approach scales well in large organizations where managing explicit resource ARNs in policies becomes unmanageable.

      heading: "IAM Best Practices",
      body: `The foundation of IAM security is **least privilege** — grant only the permissions a principal actually needs to do its job, and nothing more. The practical approach is to start with a deny-all baseline and add specific allows as they become necessary, rather than starting broad and trying to restrict later. Auditing tools like **IAM Access Analyzer** help by identifying unused permissions and resources shared externally.

The AWS root user has unrestricted access to your entire account and cannot be locked down with IAM policies. For this reason, you should enable MFA on the root user immediately, delete its access keys, and then use it only for tasks that specifically require root (like changing support plan tier). Create named IAM identities with only the permissions they need for everything else.

Wherever possible, prefer **IAM roles over long-term access keys**. Roles provide temporary credentials that expire automatically, reducing the blast radius if credentials are ever leaked. If you must use access keys — for example, in CI/CD systems that don't support IAM roles — rotate them regularly and disable old keys before deleting them. Enable MFA for console users and for sensitive API operations using the \`aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\` condition. Enable CloudTrail to log all IAM API calls, and monitor for suspicious activity like unexpected AssumeRole calls or permission policy changes.`,
