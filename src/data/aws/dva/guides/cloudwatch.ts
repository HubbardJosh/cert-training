  intro:
    "CloudWatch is the native observability service for AWS. It collects metrics, logs, and events from AWS services and your applications, enables alarms, dashboards, and automated actions, and integrates with virtually every AWS service for monitoring and operational health.",

  sections: [
    {
      heading: "Metrics",
      body: `A **metric** is a time-ordered set of data points published to CloudWatch. Every AWS service publishes metrics automatically — EC2 CPU utilization, Lambda duration, DynamoDB consumed capacity — and you can publish your own custom metrics using the \`PutMetricData\` API.

Metrics are organized into **namespaces**, which are logical containers. AWS services use namespaces like \`AWS/EC2\`, \`AWS/Lambda\`, and \`AWS/DynamoDB\`. Your application's custom metrics should go in your own namespace (like \`MyApp/Orders\`) to keep them separate from AWS-managed metrics.

Within a namespace, **dimensions** are key-value pairs that identify a specific metric instance. An EC2 CPU metric has an \`InstanceId\` dimension that distinguishes metrics from different instances. Lambda metrics have \`FunctionName\` and \`Resource\` dimensions. You use dimensions to filter and aggregate metrics — for example, viewing CPU across all instances or just one specific instance.

CloudWatch offers two resolution tiers. **Standard resolution** stores metrics at 1-minute granularity, which is what most AWS services publish by default. **High resolution** stores at 1-second granularity (set \`StorageResolution=1\` when publishing), at additional cost, which is useful for applications where sub-minute anomalies matter. Metric data is retained progressively longer at lower resolutions: 1-second data for 3 hours, 1-minute data for 15 days, 5-minute data for 63 days, and 1-hour data for 15 months.

**Metric Math** lets you perform calculations across multiple metrics to derive new values — for example, computing an error rate as \`errors / requests * 100\`. Metric Math expressions can be used in dashboards and alarms just like raw metrics.`,

For EC2 instances and on-premises servers, the **CloudWatch Agent** extends what you can monitor. By default, EC2 publishes CPU, network, and disk I/O metrics — but memory utilization and disk usage at the file system level are not published by the EC2 service itself. Installing the CloudWatch Agent gives you those operating system-level metrics, plus the ability to collect application logs from files on disk.

The **Embedded Metrics Format (EMF)** is a pattern specifically optimized for Lambda. Instead of calling \`PutMetricData\` from your function, you write structured JSON to stdout that includes a special \`_aws\` envelope. The Lambda runtime (or CloudWatch Logs agent) automatically detects the EMF format and extracts the metrics, publishing them to CloudWatch without an explicit API call. This avoids adding latency to your function's response while still capturing metrics.`,

      heading: "CloudWatch Logs",
      body: `CloudWatch Logs is the centralized logging platform for AWS. Logs are organized into **log groups** (one per application or service, where you set the retention period) and **log streams** (one per source instance — a single Lambda execution environment, a single EC2 instance, a single ECS task). Retention can be set from 1 day to 10 years, or configured to never expire. Setting appropriate retention is important — unlimited log retention accumulates cost.

**CloudWatch Logs Insights** is an interactive query engine for your logs. It uses a SQL-like syntax that supports filtering, aggregating, sorting, and visualizing log data across multiple log groups simultaneously:

\`\`\`
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /ERROR/
| stats count(*) as errorCount by bin(5m)
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 20
\`\`\`

**Metric Filters** extract metric values from log text patterns without requiring any code changes. For example, you can configure a metric filter that counts occurrences of the string "ERROR" in your Lambda logs and publishes that count as a CloudWatch metric, which you can then alarm on.

**Subscription Filters** stream log data in near real-time to other services for processing or storage: Lambda (for real-time analysis or routing), Kinesis Data Streams (for downstream consumers), Kinesis Firehose (for delivery to S3 or OpenSearch), or OpenSearch Service directly. This is how you build log aggregation pipelines and centralized logging architectures. VPC Flow Logs and CloudTrail can both publish to CloudWatch Logs for unified analysis.`,

      heading: "Alarms",
      body: `A **CloudWatch Alarm** watches a metric or Metric Math expression and changes state when the metric crosses a threshold for a configured number of consecutive evaluation periods. The three states are **OK** (metric is within the threshold), **ALARM** (metric has breached the threshold), and **INSUFFICIENT_DATA** (not enough data points to evaluate).

Alarm configuration involves several parameters that work together. The **period** is the evaluation window (60 seconds, 300 seconds, etc.). **Evaluation periods** is how many consecutive windows to check. **Datapoints to alarm** is how many of those windows must be in breach — setting this to "3 of 5" means the alarm only fires after 3 consecutive breaches within a 5-period window, reducing false positives from brief spikes. **Missing data treatment** determines how gaps in metric data affect alarm state.

When an alarm transitions to ALARM state, it can trigger actions including SNS notifications (which fan out to email, SMS, Lambda, or SQS), EC2 instance actions (stop, terminate, reboot, recover), Auto Scaling actions, and Systems Manager OpsCenter OpsItem creation.

**Composite Alarms** combine multiple alarms using AND/OR logic to create a single higher-level alarm. This reduces noise — instead of getting paged for every individual metric threshold breach, you can require that both CPU is high AND error rate is elevated before triggering an alert. **Anomaly Detection** uses ML to model the expected behavior of a metric over time (including time-of-day and day-of-week patterns) and alarms when the actual metric deviates significantly from the expected band. **CloudWatch Synthetics** lets you define canary scripts that run on a schedule and alarm if they fail, providing synthetic monitoring for your endpoints.`,

Dashboards can display metrics and alarms from multiple AWS accounts and regions in a single view, which requires setting up CloudWatch cross-account observability (where monitored accounts share metric data with a monitoring account). This is the standard approach for centralized observability in multi-account AWS environments.

CloudWatch automatically creates **service dashboards** for many AWS services — these pre-built dashboards for services like Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB appear under "Service dashboards" in the console and require no configuration.

The core capability is responding to state changes in AWS resources in near real-time. When an EC2 instance changes state, a CodePipeline execution changes status, or an S3 object is created, an event is emitted to the default EventBridge event bus. You create rules that match these events and route them to targets like Lambda functions, SQS queues, SNS topics, ECS tasks, or Step Functions state machines.

Lambda automatically publishes \`Duration\`, \`Invocations\`, \`Errors\`, \`Throttles\`, \`ConcurrentExecutions\`, and \`UnreservedConcurrentExecutions\` metrics. Alarms on error rate and throttle rate are the minimum viable monitoring for any production Lambda function.

API Gateway publishes \`Count\`, \`Latency\`, \`IntegrationLatency\`, \`4XXError\`, and \`5XXError\` per stage. Enable detailed metrics for per-route breakdowns and access logging for full request details — these are both disabled by default and must be configured explicitly.

DynamoDB emits \`ConsumedRCU\`, \`ConsumedWCU\`, \`SuccessfulRequestLatency\`, and \`ThrottledRequests\`. Alarms on \`ThrottledRequests\` are the primary signal for DynamoDB capacity issues. EC2's default metrics come at 5-minute granularity for free; enabling detailed monitoring gives 1-minute granularity at additional cost.

      question:
        "A team needs to monitor memory utilization on their EC2 instances. The metric is not appearing in CloudWatch. What is the most likely cause?",
      options: [
        "Memory metrics are not published by the EC2 service — the CloudWatch Agent must be installed",
        "Memory metrics require the instance to have an instance profile with CloudWatch permissions",
        "Memory metrics require enabling detailed EC2 monitoring",
        "Memory metrics are only available for EC2 instances in a VPC",
      ],
      correctIndex: 0,
      explanation:
        "EC2 does not publish memory utilization by default because it's an OS-level metric the hypervisor cannot observe. The CloudWatch Agent must be installed on the instance to collect and publish memory metrics. This is one of the most common EC2 monitoring gotchas.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "A Lambda function generates thousands of invocations per second. A developer wants to publish a custom business metric (order count) per invocation without adding latency. Which approach is correct?",
      options: [
        "Write structured JSON using the Embedded Metrics Format (EMF) to stdout",
        "Batch metric data and call PutMetricData every 60 seconds from a scheduled Lambda",
        "Use a Metric Filter on the Lambda log group to count invocations as a proxy",
        "Call PutMetricData in a background thread after the function returns",
      ],
      correctIndex: 0,
      explanation:
        "EMF allows Lambda to publish metrics by writing structured JSON to stdout — no API call, no added latency. The Lambda runtime (or CloudWatch Logs agent) automatically extracts and publishes the metrics. This is the recommended pattern for high-throughput Lambda metric publishing.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "An operations team receives too many CloudWatch alarm notifications. CPU alarms, memory alarms, and error rate alarms all fire independently. How can they reduce alert noise while still being notified when the system is truly degraded?",
      options: [
        "Create a Composite Alarm combining CPU, memory, and error rate alarms with AND logic",
        "Disable individual alarms and rely on CloudWatch Anomaly Detection",
        "Increase the evaluation period to 1 hour so transient spikes don't trigger alarms",
        "Increase the alarm thresholds so individual alarms fire less often",
      ],
      correctIndex: 0,
      explanation:
        "A Composite Alarm combines multiple alarm states using AND/OR logic. Requiring all three alarms (CPU AND memory AND error rate) to be in ALARM state before notifying eliminates false positives from isolated metric spikes, while still alerting when the system is genuinely degraded.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "A security team wants to count all failed SSH login attempts logged in /var/log/auth.log on EC2 instances and alarm when the count exceeds 10 in 5 minutes. What combination of CloudWatch features is needed?",
      options: [
        "CloudWatch Agent + Subscription Filter + SNS",
        "CloudWatch Logs Insights + Alarm + SNS",
        "CloudWatch Synthetics + Metric Filter + Alarm",
        "CloudWatch Agent + Metric Filter + Alarm",
      ],
      correctIndex: 3,
      explanation:
        "The CloudWatch Agent collects /var/log/auth.log and ships it to CloudWatch Logs. A Metric Filter on the log group counts occurrences of failed SSH patterns. A CloudWatch Alarm on the resulting metric triggers when the count exceeds 10 in a 5-minute period.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "A developer wants to query Lambda logs across multiple log groups for ERROR messages in the last hour and count them by function. Which CloudWatch feature enables this?",
      options: [
        "CloudWatch Logs Insights with a query spanning multiple log groups",
        "Metric Filters with per-function dimensions",
        "Subscription Filters streaming to Kinesis for aggregation",
        "CloudWatch Dashboards with Metric Math expressions",
      ],
      correctIndex: 0,
      explanation:
        "CloudWatch Logs Insights supports interactive queries across multiple log groups simultaneously using SQL-like syntax. You can filter for ERROR messages, aggregate by function name, and sort results — all interactively without needing to stream data elsewhere first.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "An alarm is in INSUFFICIENT_DATA state. What does this indicate?",
      options: [
        "The metric threshold has been breached",
        "There are not enough data points to evaluate the alarm's threshold",
        "The alarm was incorrectly configured with an invalid threshold",
        "The metric namespace does not exist",
      ],
      correctIndex: 1,
      explanation:
        "INSUFFICIENT_DATA means CloudWatch does not have enough data points to evaluate whether the alarm should be in OK or ALARM state. This is common for new alarms, sparse metrics, or when a service stops publishing metrics. How INSUFFICIENT_DATA is treated (as breaching or not) is configurable.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "A team needs to stream CloudWatch logs to an S3 bucket for long-term archival and to OpenSearch for real-time search. What is the most efficient architecture?",
      options: [
        "Create a Subscription Filter to Lambda, which fans out to both S3 and OpenSearch",
        "Create two separate Subscription Filters: one to Kinesis Firehose (for S3) and one to OpenSearch Service directly",
        "Export log groups to S3 daily using the CreateExportTask API and configure a separate pipeline for OpenSearch",
        "Use a Metric Filter to count log events and store results in S3",
      ],
      correctIndex: 1,
      explanation:
        "You can create multiple Subscription Filters on a log group. One filter streams to Kinesis Firehose for S3 archival; another streams directly to OpenSearch Service. This provides near-real-time delivery to both destinations without requiring a Lambda fan-out function.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "A company wants to monitor their REST API's health continuously and alert if specific user journeys break, even when there's no real user traffic. Which CloudWatch feature enables this?",
      options: [
        "Metric Filters on API Gateway access logs",
        "Composite Alarms combining 4XXError and 5XXError metrics",
        "CloudWatch Anomaly Detection on API Gateway latency metrics",
        "CloudWatch Synthetics canaries running scripted checks on a schedule",
      ],
      correctIndex: 3,
      explanation:
        "CloudWatch Synthetics allows you to define canary scripts that simulate user journeys against your API on a schedule. If the canary fails, an alarm fires — even when there's no real user traffic. This provides synthetic monitoring independent of actual traffic volume.",
    },
  ],
