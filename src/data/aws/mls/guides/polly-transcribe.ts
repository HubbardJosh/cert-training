      heading: "Amazon Transcribe: Automatic Speech Recognition",
      body: `Amazon Transcribe converts audio recordings to text using deep learning ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) models. It supports real-time transcription (streaming audio via WebSocket or HTTP/2) and batch transcription (S3 audio files submitted as transcription jobs). Transcribe handles 100+ languages, automatically punctuates transcripts, supports speaker identification (speaker diarization — attributing speech segments to different speakers), and produces word-level timestamps and confidence scores.

Transcribe's features critical for ML data creation include vocabulary filters (masking or removing profanity or domain-specific terms), custom vocabularies (improving accuracy for proper nouns, technical terms, and domain jargon the base model struggles with), and custom language models (fine-tuned ASR models trained on domain-specific text corpora that represent the language distribution of your target audio). Custom language models dramatically improve transcription accuracy for specialized domains like medical, legal, or financial audio.`,

            "Custom vocabulary allows you to provide a list of domain-specific terms (drug names, procedures, medical abbreviations) with hints about their pronunciation.

      heading: "Transcribe Medical and PII Redaction",
      body: `Amazon Transcribe Medical is a specialized Transcribe service trained on medical conversations and clinical terminology. It is HIPAA eligible and optimized for physician-patient conversations, radiology reports, clinical notes dictation, and pharmacy medication lists. It identifies medical terms with higher accuracy than standard Transcribe and produces a clinical note output format recognized by EHR systems.

Transcribe supports automatic PII (Personally Identifiable Information) redaction, replacing PII entities — names, phone numbers, social security numbers, addresses — in the transcript with \`[PII]\` placeholders. This is critical for ML pipelines where audio transcripts become training data for NLP models — you must de-identify the data before storage and training. Transcribe also supports content redaction that can redact PII from both the transcript text and the underlying audio, producing clean versions of both for compliant storage.`,

            "Transcribe's automatic PII redaction identifies and replaces PII entities (names, phone numbers, SSNs, addresses, account numbers) with [PII] placeholders in the output transcript. This enables compliant de-identification of audio transcripts before use as ML training data without manual annotation.",

    {
      heading: "Amazon Polly: Neural Text-to-Speech",
      body: `Amazon Polly converts text to speech using neural TTS (NTTS) and standard TTS engines. Neural voices produce more natural, human-like speech by modeling prosody and intonation at a deeper level than concatenative or parametric TTS. Polly supports 100+ voices in 30+ languages. Output can be delivered as an MP3 or OGG audio stream for real-time playback, or synthesized to S3 as an asynchronous job for long documents.

SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) controls speech characteristics in Polly: \`<break>\` adds pauses, \`<emphasis>\` stresses words, \`<prosody rate="slow">\` changes speaking rate, \`<phoneme>\` controls pronunciation of specific words, and \`<say-as interpret-as="digits">\` controls how numbers and abbreviations are spoken. SSML is essential for creating natural-sounding TTS output in ML applications — particularly voice assistants, audiobook generation, and accessibility features.`,

    {
      heading: "Polly Custom Lexicons and Brand Voices",
      body: `Polly Custom Lexicons allow you to control how specific words are pronounced using PLS (Pronunciation Lexicon Specification) or IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) notation. For ML applications involving brand names, product names, or technical acronyms, custom lexicons ensure consistent, correct pronunciation. For example, ensuring that "AWS" is spoken as "Amazon Web Services" or that "GIF" is pronounced with a hard G rather than a soft G.

Polly Brand Voice (available through AWS professional services) allows organizations to create a completely custom neural voice trained on recordings of a real human voice, providing a unique, branded audio identity. For ML applications, Brand Voice enables building products where the voice is a differentiating feature. Standard Neural voices and Brand Voices can be mixed in the same application — using Neural for dynamic content and a Brand Voice for specific branded touchpoints.`,

      heading: "Transcribe and Polly in ML Pipelines",
      body: `Transcribe and Polly are commonly used together to build voice-enabled ML inference pipelines. The pattern for a voice assistant is: microphone → Transcribe streaming (ASR) → text → NLP model or LLM (understanding and response generation) → Polly (TTS) → speaker. This pipeline converts spoken language to text, processes it with ML, and converts the ML response back to speech — enabling fully voice-driven AI applications.

For training data creation, Transcribe generates labeled text corpora from existing audio archives. Call center recordings transcribed with Transcribe and labeled for intent can train call routing classification models. Medical dictation transcribed with Transcribe Medical can train clinical NLP models. Polly generates synthetic training data for speech recognition models — by varying voice, rate, and pronunciation, you can augment ASR training datasets to improve model robustness to different speakers and accents.`,
