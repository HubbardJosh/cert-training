      body: `**Serverless** computing does not mean there are no servers — it means you do not manage them. AWS handles all the infrastructure: provisioning, scaling, patching, and availability. You provide the code and AWS takes care of everything else.

Lambda is the core AWS serverless compute service. You write a **function** — a piece of code with a defined entry point called a **handler** — and Lambda executes it in response to **events**. An event might be an HTTP request through API Gateway, a file uploaded to S3, a message in an SQS queue, a timer (scheduled event), or many other triggers.

Because Lambda scales automatically and you pay only for invocations and compute time (measured in milliseconds), it can dramatically reduce costs for workloads that are variable, infrequent, or event-driven.`,

If Lambda already has a warm execution environment from a previous invocation, it reuses it — this is a **warm start**, which is very fast. If no warm environment exists, Lambda must initialize a new one — this is a **cold start** that adds some latency (typically 100–500ms for interpreted languages).

Lambda functions have configurable **memory** (128 MB to 10,240 MB), and CPU scales proportionally with memory. The maximum **timeout** is 15 minutes per invocation. For workloads longer than 15 minutes, you need to use a different service like EC2, ECS, or AWS Step Functions to orchestrate multiple Lambda calls.

Lambda automatically **scales** the number of concurrent executions based on incoming event volume. There is no capacity to provision or manage — Lambda handles scaling transparently.`,

**API Gateway** triggers Lambda synchronously on each HTTP request, enabling you to build REST or WebSocket APIs entirely on managed infrastructure without running web servers.

**Amazon S3** triggers Lambda when objects are created, modified, or deleted. This enables event-driven processing: generate thumbnails when an image is uploaded, scan files for viruses, or kick off an ETL pipeline.

**Amazon SQS** polls a queue and invokes Lambda with batches of messages. Lambda processes the messages and SQS removes successfully processed items. This decouples message producers from consumers.

**Amazon DynamoDB Streams** triggers Lambda when table data changes, enabling real-time reactions to database events — syncing data, sending notifications, or updating caches.

**Amazon EventBridge (CloudWatch Events)** can invoke Lambda on a schedule (like a cron job) or when specific events happen in your AWS environment.

The core concept is that Lambda is **event-driven** — it does nothing until an event occurs, making it a natural fit for building reactive, loosely coupled systems.`,

You are charged for two things: the number of **requests** (invocations) and the **duration** of compute time (rounded to the nearest millisecond, measured in GB-seconds).

The **AWS Free Tier** permanently includes 1 million Lambda requests and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month. This is enough for many small applications and personal projects to run entirely within the free tier.

Compare this to running an EC2 instance: a \`t3.micro\` instance running 24/7 costs roughly $8–10 per month whether it receives traffic or not. A Lambda function processing 100,000 requests per month of 200ms each costs fractions of a cent. However, for very high, sustained traffic, EC2 can be more cost-effective than Lambda.

The key exam concept is that Lambda follows a **pay-per-use** model with no idle cost, making it economical for variable workloads.`,

This means you **never need to hardcode AWS access keys** in your code or environment variables — doing so is a security anti-pattern that can expose credentials if the code is ever leaked.

The execution role follows the **Principle of Least Privilege**: grant only the permissions the function actually needs, nothing more. For example, a function that only reads from one DynamoDB table should have read-only access to that specific table, not write access or access to other tables.

**RESTful APIs**: Combined with API Gateway, Lambda powers serverless backends that scale from zero to millions of requests without managing servers. Each request invokes a Lambda function that reads from DynamoDB or another data store and returns a response.

**File Processing**: When users upload files to S3 — images, documents, videos — Lambda functions are triggered automatically to resize images, convert formats, extract text, or run virus scans, then store the results.

**Scheduled Tasks**: EventBridge can invoke Lambda on a schedule to run nightly reports, purge old records from databases, send reminder emails, or aggregate metrics.

**Real-time Stream Processing**: Lambda processes data streams from Kinesis or DynamoDB Streams for real-time analytics, fraud detection, or data transformation.

**Automation and Glue Logic**: Lambda frequently serves as the glue between AWS services — for example, triggering a CloudFormation stack update when a CodePipeline stage completes, or sending an SNS notification when a DynamoDB item changes.`,

        "A Lambda function needs to read objects from an S3 bucket. A developer suggests hardcoding AWS access keys in the function's environment variables. What is wrong with this approach?",
      options: [
        "Lambda environment variables are limited to 4 KB and cannot store access keys",
        "Hardcoded credentials are a security risk — use an IAM execution role instead so AWS provides temporary credentials automatically",

        "Environment variables are deleted when the function scales up, losing the credentials",
      ],
      correctIndex: 1,
      explanation:
        "Hardcoding credentials in environment variables is a security anti-pattern — if the code or config is ever exposed, the keys are compromised. The correct approach is an IAM execution role attached to the function. AWS automatically injects short-lived temporary credentials at runtime, with no keys to manage or rotate manually.",
