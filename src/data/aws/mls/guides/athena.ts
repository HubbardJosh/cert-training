    "Serverless interactive SQL query service for analyzing ML datasets stored in S3",
  intro:
    "Amazon Athena is a serverless, interactive SQL query service that analyzes data directly in S3 without loading it into a database. It uses the Glue Data Catalog for schema management and supports Parquet, ORC, JSON, CSV, and Avro formats — making it the primary tool for exploratory data analysis on ML datasets stored in S3.",

  sections: [
    {
      heading: "Athena Architecture and How It Works",
      body: `Athena v3 uses Apache Trino (the open-source fork of Presto) — Trino provides improved performance and SQL compatibility. Athena is fully serverless — you pay per query based on the amount of data scanned (per TB scanned). There are no clusters to provision, no infrastructure to manage, and no data to load. You simply point Athena at S3 data registered in the Glue Data Catalog and run standard SQL. Results are written to an S3 output location, and Athena query result reuse can cache results for up to 7 days — identical queries within the reuse window are served from cache without scanning data again.

For ML workflows, Athena is the EDA tool of choice when data is already in S3. Data scientists can run complex SQL aggregations, distributions, and joins directly on training datasets to understand feature distributions, detect class imbalances, identify outliers, and validate data quality — all without spinning up an EMR cluster or loading data into Redshift. The schema-on-read model means you can query data in its raw form without ETL preprocessing.`,

          options: [
            "Per instance-hour for the Presto cluster running the query",
            "Per query submitted regardless of data scanned",
            "Per TB of data scanned — queries that scan less data cost less",
            "Per row returned in the query result",
          ],
          correctIndex: 2,
          explanation:
            "Athena charges per TB of data scanned. This means that using columnar formats like Parquet and partitioning data to reduce scan volume directly reduces query cost. Queries that scan compressed Parquet files partitioned by date cost far less than queries scanning uncompressed CSV files.",
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      heading: "Optimizing Athena Queries for ML Data",
      body: `Athena query performance and cost are heavily influenced by data format and partitioning. Columnar formats (Parquet, ORC) allow Athena to read only the columns referenced in the SELECT clause, skipping columns not needed by the query. For a training dataset with 100 columns, a query selecting 5 columns scans approximately 5% of the raw data volume — a 95% cost reduction compared to CSV. Compression within Parquet (Snappy, GZIP) further reduces scanned bytes and query time.

Partitioning divides data into directory hierarchies by column values — for example, \`s3://bucket/data/year=2024/month=06/\`. When queries include a WHERE clause filtering by partition column (\`WHERE year = 2024 AND month = 06\`), Athena only scans the matching partitions, skipping irrelevant data. For daily ML training datasets, partitioning by date ensures that queries analyzing a specific time window only scan that window's data. Partition projection (a metadata-free alternative) configures partition rules directly in Athena without requiring Glue Crawler updates for each new partition.`,

            "A data scientist queries a 50 TB S3 training dataset in CSV format daily for feature distribution analysis. Monthly Athena costs are very high. What two changes will most reduce costs?",

          explanation:
            "Converting to Parquet reduces scanned data by reading only relevant columns (columnar skip). Snappy compression further reduces bytes scanned. Partitioning by date ensures daily queries only scan that day's partition rather than the full 50 TB. These two changes typically reduce Athena costs by 80-95% for column-selective, time-filtered queries.",

    {
      heading: "Athena for ML Exploratory Data Analysis",
      body: `Athena's SQL interface makes exploratory data analysis on large datasets accessible to data scientists who are not Spark experts. Common EDA queries in ML preparation include: feature distribution histograms (\`SELECT feature, COUNT(*) FROM data GROUP BY feature\`), null value counts per column, outlier detection (\`WHERE value > AVG(value) + 3*STDDEV(value)\`), class label distribution (checking for imbalance), and join completeness validation (checking if training records have all required feature columns from joined tables).

Athena integrates with Amazon QuickSight for visualization — run SQL queries in Athena and connect QuickSight to visualize feature distributions as charts. For Jupyter notebook-based EDA, the Athena Python SDK (PyAthena or the AWS Data Wrangler library) enables running Athena queries directly from notebook cells and loading results as Pandas DataFrames. This workflow combines Athena's scale (querying TB-scale data in S3) with the Pandas/Python ecosystem familiar to data scientists.`,

      heading: "Athena Federated Query and ML Data Integration",
      body: `Athena Federated Query extends SQL analysis beyond S3 to include over 25 additional data sources including RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB, Redshift, ElastiCache, and on-premises databases. Federated queries use Lambda-based connectors — when you query a federated source, Athena invokes a Lambda function that translates the SQL into the source's native query language, executes it, and returns results in a format Athena can join with S3 data.

For ML, federated query enables feature engineering across multiple data sources in a single SQL statement — joining S3-stored behavioral data with RDS customer profiles and DynamoDB session data without ETL preprocessing. This makes it possible to run complex feature SQL across the entire data ecosystem from a single Athena query, outputting the result to S3 for SageMaker Training Job consumption. Athena also integrates with SageMaker directly: you can register Athena as a data source in SageMaker Data Wrangler to build feature pipelines using SQL without separate ETL jobs.`,

            "Athena Federated Query uses Lambda-based connectors to query non-S3 sources like RDS. You can join S3 data and RDS data in a single SQL query. The query optimizer dispatches portions of the query to the appropriate source via the Lambda connector and joins the results — eliminating separate ETL preprocessing.",

    },
    {
      heading: "Athena Workgroups and Cost Control",
      body: `Athena Workgroups provide query isolation, cost control, and access management for multi-team ML environments. Each workgroup has its own query history, query limits (maximum data scanned per query, maximum per-workgroup spend), and output S3 location. Data science teams can be assigned to specific workgroups with cost limits to prevent runaway queries from scanning the entire data lake. Workgroups also enforce encryption settings on query results stored in S3.

CloudWatch metrics for Athena track data scanned and query counts per workgroup, enabling cost allocation dashboards and budget alerts. AWS Budgets can alert when Athena costs exceed a threshold. For multi-team ML environments, the recommended governance pattern is a Workgroup per team with query data scan limits and encrypted output locations — preventing any single team from accidentally scanning the full data lake with an expensive query and ensuring result data is protected.`,

          explanation:
            "Athena Workgroups allow setting per-query scan limits — if a query would scan more than the limit, it fails before executing.
