      heading: "Core Rekognition Capabilities",
      body: `Rekognition offers a broad set of image analysis APIs that invoke pre-trained deep learning models hosted by AWS. DetectLabels identifies objects and scenes in images with confidence scores — a photo of a beach might return labels like "Beach," "Ocean," "Sand," and "Person" with 98%, 95%, 90%, and 85% confidence respectively. DetectFaces locates faces in images and returns attributes including emotion (happy, sad, surprised), estimated age range, gender, glasses, and facial landmarks (eye position, nose, mouth corners).

RecognizeCelebrities identifies public figures in images. DetectText uses OCR to extract text from images including street signs, product labels, and documents. DetectModerationLabels identifies inappropriate content (explicit nudity, violence, drugs) using a two-level taxonomy, enabling automated content filtering pipelines. All these APIs accept images from S3 or as base64-encoded bytes, and return structured JSON responses with bounding boxes and confidence scores.`,

          question:
            "A media company wants to automatically flag potentially inappropriate images uploaded by users before they are published. Which Rekognition API should they use?",
          options: [
            "DetectLabels — it identifies all objects in the image including inappropriate ones",
            "DetectFaces — it identifies the people in the image for content attribution",
            "DetectModerationLabels — it identifies explicit, suggestive, or violent content using a hierarchical taxonomy",

      ],
    },
    {
      heading: "Rekognition Custom Labels",
      body: `Rekognition Custom Labels extends the pre-trained models with domain-specific object recognition using transfer learning. You provide labeled training images (minimum 10 per label, recommended 100+), and Rekognition fine-tunes its base model on your dataset without requiring ML expertise. Custom Labels is appropriate for identifying proprietary objects — manufacturing defects, specific product SKUs, branded logos, or specialized medical imaging findings — that the base Rekognition models were not trained on.

The training process uses AutoML: you upload labeled images, Rekognition selects the appropriate model architecture and training hyperparameters automatically, and returns a custom model endpoint you call with the same API signature as standard Rekognition. Custom Labels supports both image-level labels (the whole image contains X) and bounding-box labels (object X is at coordinates [x1,y1,x2,y2]). This is Amazon's implementation of transfer learning as a managed service.`,

        {
          question:

    {
      heading: "Rekognition Video Analysis",
      body: `Rekognition Video extends image analysis capabilities to video content. Asynchronous video analysis uses \`StartLabelDetection\`, \`StartFaceDetection\`, \`StartPersonTracking\`, and similar APIs. You provide an S3 video URI, and Rekognition processes the video asynchronously, notifying you via SNS when complete. You then call the corresponding \`Get*\` API to retrieve timestamped results. This asynchronous model handles long videos (up to 8 hours) efficiently without blocking.

Rekognition Video Streaming Analysis processes live video from Kinesis Video Streams for real-time use cases like security surveillance (detecting persons at restricted locations), broadcast monitoring (identifying logos or content in live streams), and real-time attendance systems (identifying enrolled persons at events). Streaming analysis uses Rekognition Stream Processor, which continuously analyzes the Kinesis Video Stream and emits events when detected objects meet specified criteria.`,
      quiz: [
        {
          question:
            "A security system needs to detect unauthorized persons entering a restricted facility in a live camera feed. Which Rekognition feature supports this real-time use case?",

            "Rekognition Stream Processor connects to a Kinesis Video Stream and analyzes live video in real time, emitting events when detected objects or faces match specified criteria. This is the correct architecture for real-time security monitoring, rather than periodic API polling or asynchronous batch processing.",
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      heading: "Rekognition Face Search and Collections",
      body: `Rekognition Faces Collections enable scalable face search across a database of indexed faces. You create a collection, index face images using IndexFaces (which extracts facial feature vectors and stores them), then use SearchFacesByImage to find matching faces in the collection given a query image. Collections can store millions of faces and are used for identity verification, employee time-and-attendance systems, missing persons searches, and VIP customer recognition.

Rekognition stores face feature vectors (embeddings) in the collection — not the original images — which has privacy implications for GDPR and biometric data regulations. CompareFaces compares two specific face images without a collection, returning a similarity score — useful for one-to-one identity verification (verify a selfie matches a passport photo) without maintaining a database of faces. For the exam, understand the difference between SearchFacesByImage (one-to-many, requires collection) and CompareFaces (one-to-one, no collection required).`,
      quiz: [
        {
          question:
            "An HR system needs to verify that the person presenting an ID badge matches the photo on file for that employee. Which Rekognition API is most appropriate?",
          options: [
            "SearchFacesByImage — search the company's face collection for the employee",
            "CompareFaces — compare the badge photo directly against the employee's photo on file for one-to-one similarity scoring",
            "DetectFaces — detect whether a face is present in the badge image",
            "IndexFaces — add the badge scan to the face collection for future matching",
          ],
          correctIndex: 1,
          explanation:
            "CompareFaces performs one-to-one face comparison between two specific images, returning a similarity score. This is appropriate for identity verification (badge vs. file photo) without maintaining a collection. SearchFacesByImage is for one-to-many search across a collection of indexed faces.",
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      heading: "Rekognition Integration Patterns and Limitations",
      body: `Rekognition integrates with Lambda for event-driven image analysis — an S3 PutObject event triggers Lambda, which calls Rekognition and writes results to DynamoDB or publishes to SNS. This serverless pattern is common for processing user-uploaded images at scale. Rekognition results can feed into Step Functions workflows for multi-step content moderation pipelines: detect labels, check moderation, extract text, compare faces, and make a publish/reject decision.

Rekognition operates as a pre-trained managed service and is appropriate when the target objects are well-represented in its training data. It does not replace custom training for highly specialized or proprietary visual recognition tasks — those require Rekognition Custom Labels or SageMaker with a custom computer vision model. Know the confidence score threshold concept: in content moderation, a lower threshold (e.g., 50%) is more conservative (flags more content), while a higher threshold (e.g., 90%) is more permissive (only flags high-confidence violations).`,
      quiz: [
        {
          question:
            "A content platform uses Rekognition DetectModerationLabels and wants to be very conservative, flagging even low-confidence potentially inappropriate content for human review. What should they set?",
          options: [
            "A high confidence threshold (e.g., 90%) — high confidence means more certain violations",
            "A low confidence threshold (e.g., 50%) — flags more content for review, catching borderline cases",
            "The confidence threshold does not affect what Rekognition returns — it always returns all labels",
            "A threshold of exactly 75% — the AWS recommended setting for conservative moderation",
          ],
          correctIndex: 1,
          explanation:
            "Setting a lower confidence threshold causes more labels to pass the threshold and be flagged for review, resulting in conservative moderation (more flags, fewer misses). A higher threshold means only high-confidence violations are flagged, letting borderline content through. For conservative moderation requiring human review, lower the threshold.",
