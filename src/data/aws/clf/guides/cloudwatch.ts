      body: `CloudWatch collects **metrics** — time-series data points that measure the performance and behavior of AWS services. Every AWS service publishes metrics to CloudWatch automatically. For example, EC2 publishes \`CPUUtilization\`, \`NetworkIn\`, and \`DiskReadOps\`. RDS publishes \`DatabaseConnections\` and \`FreeStorageSpace\`. Lambda publishes \`Invocations\`, \`Duration\`, and \`Errors\`.

Metrics are organized by **namespace** (like \`AWS/EC2\` or \`AWS/Lambda\`) and **dimensions** (filters like \`InstanceId\` or \`FunctionName\`). The default resolution for CloudWatch metrics is **1-minute intervals**, though you can enable **high-resolution metrics** at 1-second intervals for some services.

By default, EC2 provides basic monitoring (5-minute intervals) for free. Enabling **detailed monitoring** switches to 1-minute intervals and provides more granular visibility, though it costs extra.

You can also publish your own **custom metrics** from your applications using the CloudWatch API or agents. For example, your application can track active user sessions, queue processing rate, or business metrics like orders per minute.`,

An alarm monitors a single metric over a time period and transitions between three states: **OK** (metric is within threshold), **ALARM** (metric breached the threshold), and **INSUFFICIENT_DATA** (not enough data to determine state).

When an alarm transitions to ALARM state, it can trigger actions:
- **SNS notification**: send an email, SMS, or trigger other AWS services via an SNS topic
- **EC2 action**: stop, terminate, reboot, or recover an EC2 instance
- **Auto Scaling action**: add or remove EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling Group
- **Systems Manager action**: run an Automation runbook

Common alarm patterns include: CPU exceeding 90% for 5 consecutive minutes triggers a scale-out event; error rate above 1% triggers a PagerDuty alert; DLQ message count above 0 triggers an investigation alert.

**Composite Alarms** combine multiple alarms using boolean logic (AND/OR), letting you create sophisticated alerting conditions like "alert only if CPU is high AND network throughput is low."`,

Logs are organized into **Log Groups** (typically one per application or service) and **Log Streams** (typically one per resource instance, like one stream per EC2 instance). Log data is retained for a configurable period from 1 day to 10 years, or set to never expire.

The **CloudWatch Logs Agent** and **CloudWatch Unified Agent** run on EC2 instances to ship logs (application logs, system logs) to CloudWatch. Lambda automatically writes to CloudWatch Logs without any configuration.

**Log Insights** provides an interactive query language to search and analyze log data. You can write queries to filter logs by error patterns, aggregate counts by time, or correlate events across log groups. This is powerful for troubleshooting and investigation.

**Metric Filters** extract metric data from log events. For example, you can define a filter that counts log lines containing "ERROR" and publish that count as a metric — allowing you to alarm when your error rate increases, even though the underlying data is in logs rather than native metrics.`,

Dashboards are shared across an AWS account and can be made public (accessible without AWS credentials) for stakeholder visibility or status pages.

**CloudWatch Events** (now **Amazon EventBridge**) detects changes in your AWS environment and routes events to targets. For example, you can create a rule that runs a Lambda function every time an EC2 instance changes state, or that triggers an SNS notification when a CloudFormation stack deployment fails.

Scheduled rules in EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events) work like a serverless cron job — you define a schedule (e.g., every day at 8 AM UTC) and EventBridge invokes a target (Lambda, SNS, SQS, Step Functions) on that schedule without any server to manage.`,
