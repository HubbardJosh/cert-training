      body: `Secrets Manager stores sensitive configuration values as **secrets** — encrypted key-value pairs (stored as JSON) or plain text strings, each with a unique ARN and optional human-readable name. The typical pattern for database credentials stores them as a JSON object:
\`\`\`
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "s3cr3t",
  "host": "db.example.com",
  "port": 5432
}
\`\`\`
This structured format lets your application parse the JSON and extract individual fields rather than treating the entire secret as an opaque string.

Secrets Manager versions every change to a secret's value, using **staging labels** to track which version is active. \`AWSCURRENT\` is the version returned by default when you call \`GetSecretValue\` without specifying a version. During rotation, \`AWSPENDING\` holds the new credential being set up before it becomes active. Once rotation completes, \`AWSPENDING\` becomes \`AWSCURRENT\` and the previous active version is labeled \`AWSPREVIOUS\`. Applications that always fetch \`AWSCURRENT\` automatically get the rotated credential without any code changes.

The cost model is straightforward: $0.40 per secret per month plus $0.05 per 10,000 API calls. Secrets replicated to other regions cost an additional $0.40 per region per month. For applications with many secrets or very high access rates, caching the secret value in memory (rather than calling \`GetSecretValue\` on every request) keeps API call costs manageable.`,

      heading: "Automatic Rotation",
      body: `The most important capability that distinguishes Secrets Manager from simpler credential stores is **automatic rotation** — the ability to update a secret's value on a schedule without any manual intervention or application downtime.

Rotation is implemented through a **Lambda function** that Secrets Manager invokes at the configured interval (a fixed number of days or a cron expression). Secrets Manager provides built-in Lambda functions for the most common cases: Amazon RDS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MariaDB), Amazon Redshift, Amazon DocumentDB, and Amazon ElastiCache. For custom rotation scenarios — third-party APIs, on-premises databases — you write your own rotation Lambda.

The rotation process follows four phases, with Secrets Manager calling your Lambda function once for each:

1. **createSecret** — the Lambda generates a new credential and stores it as \`AWSPENDING\`.
2. **setSecret** — the Lambda sets the new credential on the actual database or service (so both old and new passwords are currently valid).
3. **testSecret** — the Lambda verifies that \`AWSPENDING\` works correctly by authenticating with it.
4. **finishSecret** — Secrets Manager promotes \`AWSPENDING\` to \`AWSCURRENT\` and labels the old version \`AWSPREVIOUS\`.

During the rotation window, both the old and new passwords are valid, which means applications using the old password continue to work through the transition. The only edge case is applications that **cache** the secret value without refreshing it. If an application caches the password and the rotation completes, the next authentication with the cached old password will fail. The correct pattern is to catch authentication failures, call \`GetSecretValue\` to refresh the cached value, and retry the authentication once.`,

    {
      heading: "Accessing Secrets",
      body: `The primary API for reading a secret is \`GetSecretValue\`, which returns the \`AWSCURRENT\` version by default. The calling principal needs \`secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\` permission on the secret's ARN in their IAM policy.

Because API calls have both latency and cost implications, the recommended approach is to cache the secret value in your application's memory rather than calling \`GetSecretValue\` on every request. The AWS Secrets Manager caching client (available for Java, Python, Go, and .NET) handles caching automatically, with a configurable TTL (defaulting to one hour) and an important behavior: if authentication with the cached credential fails, the client automatically refreshes the cache and retries — detecting rotation transparently without application logic.

For **Lambda functions**, the pattern is to call \`GetSecretValue\` during initialization (outside the handler function) and store the credential in a module-level variable. This executes once per container lifecycle, not once per invocation, keeping both latency and API call costs low. If authentication fails inside the handler (indicating rotation occurred), refresh the cached value and retry once.

\`\`\`typescript
import { SecretsManagerClient, GetSecretValueCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-secrets-manager";

const sm = new SecretsManagerClient({});
let cachedCreds: { username: string; password: string; host: string } | undefined;

async function getCreds() {

  }
  return cachedCreds!;
}

export const handler = async () => {
  let creds = await getCreds();

      await queryDb(creds);             // retry once
    } else throw err;
  }
};
\`\`\`

**ECS and Fargate** tasks have an even simpler integration: reference secrets in the task definition's \`secrets\` field by name or ARN, and ECS fetches and decrypts them at task launch time, injecting them as environment variables. Your application reads standard environment variables — no SDK code, no caching logic, no credential management needed. The **task execution role** (not the task role) needs \`secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\` permission, since it's the ECS infrastructure making the call on the task's behalf, not the application code.`,

The **resource-based policy** attached directly to the secret specifies which principals can perform which actions on that secret. This is required for cross-account access: without a resource policy that explicitly allows the external account's principal, no IAM policy in that account can grant access, regardless of how permissive it is. The **IAM identity policy** on the calling principal must also grant the relevant \`secretsmanager:\` actions on the secret's ARN. For same-account access, the resource policy is optional — IAM policies alone can grant access — but it's sometimes used to restrict which services or roles within the same account can access a particularly sensitive secret.

Useful condition keys for fine-grained control include \`secretsmanager:SecretId\` (restricting access to specific secrets by ARN or name), \`secretsmanager:ResourceTag/tag-key\` (attribute-based access control using tags), and \`secretsmanager:VersionStage\` (restricting access to specific staging labels, so one role can only access \`AWSCURRENT\` while the rotation Lambda can access \`AWSPENDING\`).

The key actions to know are \`secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\` (read the current value), \`secretsmanager:PutSecretValue\` (write a new value), \`secretsmanager:RotateSecret\` (trigger rotation), \`secretsmanager:DeleteSecret\` (delete the secret, with a recovery window), and \`secretsmanager:DescribeSecret\` (read metadata without reading the value).`,

**Secrets Manager** is purpose-built for credentials that need to rotate. Its defining features are built-in automatic rotation with managed Lambda functions for common AWS services, native cross-account secret sharing, versioning with staging labels for zero-downtime rotation, and comprehensive CloudTrail auditing of every access. The cost — $0.40 per secret per month — is justified when you need these capabilities for database passwords, API keys, or OAuth tokens in production environments.

**SSM Parameter Store Standard** is free (up to 10,000 parameters with 4 KB values) and is appropriate for non-rotating configuration values: feature flags, environment-specific endpoints, application settings, and any sensitive-but-stable data where the free tier's simplicity outweighs Secrets Manager's capabilities. **SecureString** parameters are encrypted with KMS, making them suitable for passwords you manage manually without automated rotation. **SSM Parameter Store Advanced** costs $0.05 per parameter per month and supports 8 KB values and parameter policies (expiration notifications, auto-deletion) but still lacks built-in rotation.

The practical decision rule: if the secret needs to rotate automatically — especially database credentials in production — use Secrets Manager. For application configuration, feature flags, infrastructure parameters, and sensitive values that don't change often, Parameter Store is free and fully functional.

      heading: "Secrets Manager with Other Services",
      body: `**Secrets Manager + Lambda** is the most common integration pattern for serverless applications. Lambda functions fetch database credentials or API keys at initialization time, cache them in module-level variables, and implement a refresh-on-auth-failure retry pattern. This eliminates hard-coded credentials from code, environment variable injection of sensitive values, and the operational burden of coordinating credential updates across deployed functions.

**Secrets Manager + ECS/Fargate** uses task definition secrets injection. The \`secrets\` field in the container definition specifies which Secrets Manager ARNs to fetch at task launch, and the container receives them as environment variables. Rotating a database password becomes entirely transparent to running tasks — old tasks continue using their injected credential until they're replaced by new task launches that pick up the updated secret automatically.

**Secrets Manager + RDS** provides the tightest integration: Secrets Manager's built-in RDS rotation Lambda handles both updating the RDS user's password and updating the secret value atomically, with no downtime. The Lambda performs all four rotation phases correctly, including the step where both old and new passwords are simultaneously valid.

**Secrets Manager + CloudFormation** supports dynamic references that inject secret values directly into CloudFormation resource properties at deploy time: \`{{resolve:secretsmanager:MySecret:SecretString:password}}\`. This is useful for resources that need credentials during stack creation, like RDS master passwords. **Secrets Manager + KMS** is automatic: every secret is encrypted at rest with KMS, using the AWS managed key by default or a CMK you specify. Every \`GetSecretValue\` call triggers a KMS \`Decrypt\` internally, which is logged in CloudTrail — providing a complete audit trail of who accessed which secret and when.`,
