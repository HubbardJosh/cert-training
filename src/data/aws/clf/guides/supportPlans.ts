      body: `AWS support plans are tiered by the level of technical assistance, response time guarantees, and proactive services included. Choosing the right plan depends on the criticality of your workloads, your team's AWS expertise, and your budget.

All AWS accounts include **Basic Support** automatically at no cost. As your AWS usage matures and your workloads become more critical, upgrading to a paid plan provides access to faster response times, more Trusted Advisor checks, and dedicated technical account management.

The five plans are: **Basic** (free), **Developer** (monthly fee, starting ~$29/month or 3% of monthly usage), **Business** (monthly fee, starting ~$100/month or 10% of usage), **Enterprise On-Ramp** (monthly fee, starting ~$5,500/month or 10% of usage), and **Enterprise** (monthly fee, starting $15,000/month or a percentage of usage). For the Cloud Practitioner exam, you need to know the key features and differentiators of each plan.`,

Basic Support provides **seven core Trusted Advisor checks** in the Security and Service Limits categories. These checks identify the most critical issues: security groups with unrestricted access, unused IAM access keys, S3 bucket public access, and whether you are approaching service limits.

Basic Support does not include access to **AWS technical support engineers** for case creation. If you have a technical problem with your account or resources, you cannot open a support case. You can contact AWS for billing and account questions.`,

**Business Support** is AWS's recommended plan for production workloads. It adds:
- **24/7 phone, email, and chat access** to Cloud Support Engineers
- **1-hour response** for production system down scenarios
- **4-hour response** for production system impairment
- **Full Trusted Advisor checks** — all checks across all five categories (Security, Performance, Cost Optimization, Fault Tolerance, and Service Limits)
- **AWS Support API** to programmatically create cases and retrieve information
- **Infrastructure Event Management** support (for additional fee) for planned events like product launches
- **Unlimited contacts** can open support cases

The key difference between Developer and Business is the 24/7 access to Cloud Support Engineers with guaranteed response SLAs for production outages, and the full suite of Trusted Advisor checks.`,

Enterprise Support adds everything in Business Support plus:

- **Concierge Support Team**: billing and account experts for large enterprises
- **Infrastructure Event Management** included (for product launches, migrations)
- **Access to online courses, labs, and training** (AWS Support for AWS Well-Architected Reviews)

The **TAM** is the most distinctive feature of Enterprise Support. A TAM is not just reactive support — they proactively engage with you, help you prepare for events, review your architecture for risks, and advocate for your needs within AWS. Large enterprises managing significant AWS workloads find the TAM relationship invaluable.

**Enterprise On-Ramp** is a middle tier between Business and full Enterprise, with a pool of TAMs (rather than a dedicated one) and 30-minute response for critical issues, at a lower price point than Enterprise.`,

**Cost Optimization**: identifies unused or underutilized resources like idle EC2 instances, unattached EBS volumes, and Reserved Instances with low utilization. These recommendations can directly reduce your AWS bill.

**Performance**: checks for over-utilized EC2 instances, CloudFront configuration improvements, and opportunities to use provisioned IOPS for high-throughput databases.

**Security**: checks for overly permissive security group rules, IAM users without MFA, S3 buckets with public access, and root account access key existence. These are the seven free checks available to all accounts.

**Fault Tolerance**: checks for EC2 instances not in multiple AZs, RDS Multi-AZ not enabled, EBS volumes without recent snapshots, and Route 53 health checks.

**Service Limits**: checks how close you are to AWS service quotas across regions, helping you request limit increases before hitting them during peak events.

Only **Business and Enterprise Support** provide access to all Trusted Advisor checks. Basic and Developer plans access only the seven core security and service limits checks.`,
