      heading: "Core IAM Concepts",
      body: `IAM is a global service — it is not region-specific. Every interaction with AWS goes through IAM, which evaluates whether the requesting principal has permission to perform the requested action on the target resource.

The four fundamental building blocks of IAM are **Users**, **Groups**, **Roles**, and **Policies**.

An **IAM User** represents a person or application with long-term credentials (username/password or access keys). Users are best suited for human administrators and developers who need console or programmatic access. For applications, roles are strongly preferred over users.

An **IAM Group** is a collection of users. You attach policies to groups rather than individual users, making permission management scalable — adding a user to the Developers group automatically grants them all developer permissions.

An **IAM Role** is an identity with permissions that can be assumed by trusted entities: AWS services (like EC2 or Lambda), users from another account, or federated identities. Roles issue temporary security credentials rather than long-term access keys, making them more secure.

An **IAM Policy** is a JSON document that defines permissions. Policies state which **actions** (e.g., \`s3:GetObject\`) are allowed or denied on which **resources** (e.g., a specific S3 bucket ARN).`,

    {
      heading: "Policies and the Principle of Least Privilege",
      body: `IAM policies are the mechanism through which permissions are granted and denied. Understanding how policies work is fundamental to AWS security.

A policy document contains one or more **statements**, each with an **Effect** (Allow or Deny), an **Action** (the API operation), and a **Resource** (the ARN of the AWS resource). An optional **Condition** can restrict when the policy applies (e.g., only from a specific IP, only when MFA is used).

**Managed Policies** are standalone policies you can attach to multiple users, groups, or roles. AWS provides **AWS Managed Policies** (maintained by AWS, like \`AdministratorAccess\` or \`ReadOnlyAccess\`) and you can create **Customer Managed Policies** for your specific needs.

**Inline Policies** are embedded directly into a single user, group, or role. They are tightly coupled and cannot be reused, so managed policies are generally preferred.

The **Principle of Least Privilege** is the foundational security concept that every user or service should have only the minimum permissions necessary to perform its function. Start with no permissions and grant only what is specifically needed. IAM helps enforce this with **IAM Access Analyzer** and **IAM Credentials Report**, which identify unused permissions and credentials.`,

When an EC2 instance needs to read from S3, you create a role with an S3 read policy, attach it to the instance as an **instance profile**, and the application running on EC2 can then call S3 without any access keys. The instance automatically retrieves temporary credentials from the instance metadata endpoint. Note that **instance profiles are an EC2-specific construct** — they are the container mechanism AWS uses to pass a role to an EC2 instance. Other services (Lambda, ECS, EKS, etc.) have their own role-attachment mechanisms and do not use instance profiles.

Similarly, when a Lambda function needs to write to DynamoDB, you attach a role with DynamoDB write permissions to the Lambda function. AWS rotates the temporary credentials automatically.

This pattern — **services assuming roles with least-privilege permissions** — is the AWS-recommended approach for service-to-service authentication and is far more secure than distributing access keys.`,

**Cross-Account Access** uses IAM roles to allow principals in one AWS account to access resources in another. For example, a developer in account A can assume a role in account B to deploy infrastructure there, without needing separate credentials for account B.

**Identity Federation** allows users who already have identities in an external identity provider (like Microsoft Active Directory, Google, or Okta) to assume IAM roles and access AWS resources. This is often called **Single Sign-On (SSO)**.

**AWS IAM Identity Center** (formerly AWS SSO) is the recommended service for centrally managing access across multiple AWS accounts and applications. It integrates with existing identity providers and provides a portal where users sign in once to access all their permitted AWS accounts.
