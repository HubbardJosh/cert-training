      "The 'M of N' (datapoints to alarm) configuration prevents transient spikes from triggering alarms. By requiring 3 of 5 consecutive 1-minute periods to breach the threshold, a brief 1-minute spike will not trigger the alarm — it needs to persist for at least 3 minutes. Increasing timeout reduces actual errors but doesn't fix alarm sensitivity. Composite alarms combine independent alarm states. Raising the threshold may miss real errors.",
    optionExplanations: [
      "Incorrect. The 'M of N' datapoints-to-alarm setting (e.g., 3 of 5 consecutive 1-minute periods) requires the threshold to be breached persistently before alerting, so a single brief spike that resolves within one period does not trigger the alarm.",

      "Incorrect. A Composite Alarm ANDs or ORs the states of other independent alarms; it does not add temporal smoothing to a single metric and would not prevent a false positive caused by a one-period spike.",
      "Correct. Raising the threshold means more errors must occur before the alarm fires, but a high spike could still breach a higher threshold in a single period; this trades false positives for missed real incidents rather than filtering transient noise.",
