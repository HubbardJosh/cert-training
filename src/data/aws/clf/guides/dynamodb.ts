      heading: "What Is DynamoDB?",
      body: `DynamoDB is a **NoSQL** (non-relational) database, which means it does not use tables with fixed schemas and SQL queries in the traditional sense. Instead, DynamoDB stores **items** (analogous to rows) in **tables**, where each item can have a different set of **attributes** (analogous to columns). This schema-less nature makes it flexible for evolving data models.

The key difference from relational databases like RDS is that DynamoDB is optimized for **key-value and document access patterns** rather than complex ad-hoc queries with joins. If your application primarily accesses data by a specific key (user ID, order ID, session token), DynamoDB is an excellent fit. If your application needs complex multi-table joins or ad-hoc reporting queries, a relational database may be more appropriate.

DynamoDB is **fully managed and serverless** — there is no database engine to install, no infrastructure to manage, and no capacity to provision manually (in on-demand mode). It scales to handle millions of requests per second automatically.`,

      heading: "Keys and Data Model",
      body: `Every DynamoDB table has a **primary key** that uniquely identifies each item. There are two types:

A **Simple Primary Key** consists of just a **Partition Key** (also called a hash key). DynamoDB uses the partition key to determine which physical partition stores the item. All items with the same partition key are in the same partition.

A **Composite Primary Key** combines a **Partition Key** and a **Sort Key** (range key). Items with the same partition key are stored together and sorted by the sort key, allowing efficient range queries within a partition.

For example, a table of user orders might use \`userId\` as the partition key and \`orderId\` as the sort key. You can then query "all orders for user 123" efficiently.

**Attributes** are the data fields of an item — DynamoDB supports strings, numbers, booleans, binary data, lists, maps, and sets. There is no fixed schema; each item can have different attributes beyond the required key attributes.

**Global Secondary Indexes (GSIs)** allow you to query the table by attributes other than the primary key, creating an alternate view of the data with a different partition key and sort key.`,

**On-Demand Mode** (the simpler option) automatically scales to accommodate any traffic level. You pay per request — per read request unit (RRU) and write request unit (WRU) — with no capacity planning needed. This mode is ideal for unpredictable traffic, new applications, or workloads with significant spikes.

**Provisioned Mode** requires you to specify the number of **Read Capacity Units (RCUs)** and **Write Capacity Units (WCUs)** per second your table needs. You can enable **Auto Scaling** to automatically adjust provisioned capacity based on actual traffic, keeping utilization near a target percentage. Provisioned mode is more cost-effective for predictable, steady traffic.

One RCU supports one strongly consistent read (or two eventually consistent reads) of an item up to 4 KB per second. One WCU supports one write of an item up to 1 KB per second. For the Cloud Practitioner exam, you do not need to calculate RCUs and WCUs — just understand that capacity modes exist and on-demand is simpler.`,

Any region can serve both reads and writes, and DynamoDB automatically propagates changes to all other regions within seconds. Global Tables provide **extremely low latency** for globally distributed applications and act as a built-in disaster recovery solution — if a region fails, your application can seamlessly use another region.

**Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)** continuously backs up your table and lets you restore it to any second within the past 35 days. Enabling PITR is a best practice for production tables. **On-demand backups** create a full backup of your table at any point in time, stored until you delete them.`,

      heading: "DynamoDB Streams and Event-Driven Patterns",
      body: `**DynamoDB Streams** captures a time-ordered sequence of item-level changes (inserts, updates, deletes) to a table. The stream records each change within 24 hours, and other services can consume these changes in near-real-time.

The most common pattern is to connect DynamoDB Streams to a **Lambda function**. Every time an item changes in DynamoDB, Lambda is invoked automatically with the change record. This enables powerful event-driven patterns:
- Sending a welcome email when a new user record is created
- Updating a search index when a product listing changes
- Replicating changes to another data store for analytics
- Invalidating a cache entry when the underlying data is updated

For the Cloud Practitioner exam, the key concept is that DynamoDB Streams enables **reactive, event-driven architectures** where other parts of your system automatically respond to database changes.

**DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)** is a fully managed, in-memory cache purpose-built for DynamoDB. DAX delivers **microsecond read latency** by caching DynamoDB read results in memory and serving repeated requests directly from the cache without hitting the main table. DAX is API-compatible with DynamoDB, so switching requires minimal code changes. It is ideal for read-heavy workloads like leaderboards, product catalogs, or real-time bidding systems that require the absolute lowest read latency.

DynamoDB is also commonly used with **Amazon ElastiCache** (Redis) as a more general-purpose caching layer. For read-heavy workloads, your application reads from ElastiCache first and only queries DynamoDB on a cache miss, reducing latency and read costs.`,
