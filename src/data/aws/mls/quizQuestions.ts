      "Which SageMaker Pipelines feature allows the same pipeline to run with different input parameters (e.g., different datasets or hyperparameters) without modifying the pipeline definition?",
    options: [
      "Pipeline Steps",
      "Pipeline Parameters",
      "Pipeline Conditions",
      "Pipeline Callbacks",
    ],
    correctIndices: [1],
    explanation:
      "Pipeline Parameters are named variables defined at pipeline creation time with default values. When starting a pipeline execution, you can override parameter values (e.g., specify a new training dataset S3 path) without changing the pipeline definition itself.",

    question:
      "Which TWO practices help reduce SageMaker training costs in a production MLOps environment?",
    options: [
      "Using Spot Training instances for fault-tolerant training jobs with checkpointing",
      "Always using the largest available GPU instance for all training jobs",
      "Using SageMaker Managed Warm Pools to reduce startup time for iterative experiments",
      "Disabling distributed training to simplify infrastructure",
      "Running all training jobs on a single shared notebook instance",
    ],
    correctIndices: [0, 2],
    explanation:
      "Spot Training uses EC2 Spot capacity at up to 90% discount; checkpointing to S3 allows jobs to resume after interruption. Managed Warm Pools keep compute infrastructure warm between training jobs, eliminating startup latency and reducing the overhead cost of iterative experimentation.",
