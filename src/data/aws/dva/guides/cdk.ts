  intro:
    "AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) lets you define AWS infrastructure using TypeScript, Python, Java, Go, C#, or JavaScript. CDK code synthesizes into CloudFormation templates. You get IDE autocompletion, type safety, loops, conditionals, and reusable constructs — dramatically reducing the verbosity of raw CloudFormation.",

  sections: [
    {
      heading: "Core Concepts",
      body: `CDK is organized around a hierarchy of three concepts. An **App** is the root of a CDK application and contains one or more Stacks. A **Stack** maps directly to a CloudFormation stack and represents a deployable unit — you typically have one stack per environment (account and region combination). A **Construct** is the fundamental building block, representing one or more CloudFormation resources.

Constructs come in three levels of abstraction, called L1, L2, and L3. **L1 constructs** (prefixed with \`Cfn\`, like \`CfnBucket\`) are direct, one-to-one wrappers around CloudFormation resources. They expose every CloudFormation property but provide no defaults or helper methods — they're the escape hatch when you need full control. **L2 constructs** are the most commonly used: they wrap resources with sensible defaults and convenience methods. \`Bucket\`, \`Function\`, and \`Table\` are L2 constructs — they set secure defaults automatically and provide \`grant*()\` methods for IAM. **L3 constructs** (also called patterns) compose multiple resources to implement a common architecture, like \`ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService\` or \`LambdaRestApi\`, which stand up an entire stack of infrastructure in a few lines of code.

When you run \`cdk synth\`, CDK evaluates your code and emits a standard CloudFormation template to the \`cdk.out/\` directory. All CloudFormation features apply — CDK is ultimately just a code-based way to generate those templates.`,

cdk deploy MyStack
cdk deploy --all  # deploy all stacks in the app
cdk deploy --require-approval never  # skip manual approval for security group changes
\`\`\`

\`cdk destroy\` tears down the stack and all its resources, respecting each resource's \`RemovalPolicy\`. \`cdk ls\` lists all stacks in the app. \`cdk watch\` monitors for code changes and automatically deploys — useful for Lambda development, though \`sam sync\` is faster for Lambda-only changes.

import * as ecs from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-ecs-patterns';

L3 pattern constructs are particularly powerful for common architectures. \`ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService\` creates an ALB, ECS Fargate service, task definition, target group, and all associated security groups in roughly 10 lines of CDK. \`LambdaRestApi\` creates an API Gateway REST API with Lambda proxy integration. \`SqsEventSource\` configures a Lambda event source mapping for SQS.

You can create your own reusable constructs by extending the \`Construct\` base class. An organization can publish a library of approved, secure constructs that teams use as building blocks — ensuring consistent security settings across projects without each team needing to know the details.

When an L2 construct doesn't expose a property you need, the **escape hatch** pattern lets you access the underlying L1 resource:

\`\`\`typescript
const cfnBucket = bucket.node.defaultChild as s3.CfnBucket;
cfnBucket.addPropertyOverride('LifecycleConfiguration.Rules.0.Status', 'Disabled');

      heading: "CDK vs CloudFormation vs SAM",
      body: `All three tools deploy via CloudFormation — the difference is in the authoring experience and the level of abstraction they provide.

**CloudFormation** templates are declarative JSON or YAML. They're explicit, reviewable, and completely portable across teams and tools. The downside is verbosity — a production-grade serverless application can require thousands of lines of YAML. CloudFormation is the right choice for organizations that require static, reviewed templates for compliance, or that standardize on hand-authored templates.

**SAM** is a CloudFormation extension (a Transform) that provides simplified syntax specifically for serverless resources. A Lambda function with an API Gateway trigger that would be 100+ lines in CloudFormation is 10 lines in SAM. SAM's killer feature for developers is the CLI: \`sam local invoke\` and \`sam local start-api\` run your Lambda functions and API locally in Docker containers. SAM is the right choice for pure serverless workloads where local testing and YAML-based authoring are preferred.

**CDK** is the right choice when your infrastructure is complex enough to benefit from programming language features — loops, conditionals, functions, classes, and type systems. It's particularly powerful for teams that want to share infrastructure patterns across projects via construct libraries. CDK generates CloudFormation, so everything CloudFormation can do, CDK can do too, plus you get IDE support, compile-time validation, and the ability to write tests for your infrastructure code.`,

CDK's integration with **Lambda** includes the \`NodejsFunction\` construct (from \`@aws-cdk/aws-lambda-nodejs\`), which automatically bundles TypeScript with esbuild during synthesis. You don't need a separate build step — CDK handles the transpilation and bundling as part of \`cdk synth\`.

For testing CDK infrastructure code, \`aws-cdk-lib/assertions\` provides a test framework that evaluates the synthesized CloudFormation template:

\`\`\`typescript
Template.fromStack(myStack).hasResourceProperties('AWS::S3::Bucket', {
