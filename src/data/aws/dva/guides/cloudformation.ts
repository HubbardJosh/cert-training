Description: My application stack

Parameters:
  Environment:

Resources:
  MyBucket:

    Properties:
      BucketName: !Sub "my-app-\${Environment}"

**Parameters** are runtime inputs that callers provide when creating or updating the stack. Types include String, Number, comma-delimited List, and AWS-specific types like \`AWS::EC2::KeyPair::KeyName\` (validated against your account) and \`AWS::SSM::Parameter::Value<String>\` (fetches the value live from SSM at deploy time). **Mappings** are static lookup tables — for example, AMI IDs per region — accessed with \`!FindInMap [MapName, Key1, Key2]\`. **Conditions** are boolean expressions built from parameter values; resources and properties can be conditionally created or set using \`!If\`. **Outputs** export values (like resource ARNs or endpoint URLs) for display after stack creation or for use by other stacks via cross-stack references.`,

The most frequently used are \`!Ref\` (returns a resource's ID or a parameter's value), \`!Sub\` (performs string interpolation with \`\${Variable}\` syntax), and \`!GetAtt\` (retrieves a specific attribute from a resource, like \`!GetAtt MyBucket.Arn\`). Others include \`!Join\`, \`!Select\`, \`!If\`, \`!FindInMap\`, \`!ImportValue\` (for cross-stack references), \`!Split\`, \`!Base64\` (for EC2 UserData), and \`!Cidr\` (for generating CIDR blocks).

**Pseudo-parameters** are built-in values that CloudFormation resolves automatically — \`AWS::AccountId\`, \`AWS::Region\`, \`AWS::StackName\`, \`AWS::StackId\`, and \`AWS::NoValue\` (which removes a property when used in a conditional expression).

**Dynamic References** let you pull values from external sources without hardcoding them in the template:
- \`{{resolve:ssm:/myapp/param}}\` fetches a value from SSM Parameter Store at deploy time
- \`{{resolve:ssm-secure:/myapp/param}}\` fetches a SecureString parameter
- \`{{resolve:secretsmanager:MySecret:SecretString:password}}\` fetches a specific field from Secrets Manager

Dynamic references are especially powerful for database passwords — you store the password in Secrets Manager and reference it from the template, so the password never appears in the template itself.`,

      heading: "Stacks & Change Sets",
      body: `A **stack** is the fundamental unit of deployment in CloudFormation — a collection of AWS resources managed together. When you create a stack, CloudFormation provisions all the resources in the template in the correct dependency order. When you update a stack, CloudFormation compares the new template against the currently deployed stack and determines what changed.

**Change Sets** are the safe way to perform updates. Instead of executing an update immediately, you create a change set — CloudFormation computes what would change (additions, modifications, replacements, deletions) and presents it for review before you execute it. This is critical for catching **resource replacements** before they happen: some property changes cause CloudFormation to create a new resource and delete the old one, which means a new ARN or endpoint. This would break anything pointing to the old resource.

CloudFormation has three update behaviors: **No interruption** (resource is updated in place, no downtime), **Some interruption** (brief outage, like changing an EC2 instance type which requires a reboot), and **Replacement** (a new resource is created and the old one is deleted after the new one is healthy).

**DeletionPolicy** controls what happens to a resource when the stack is deleted. The default is \`Delete\`. \`Retain\` removes the resource from CloudFormation's management but leaves it running. \`Snapshot\` takes a final snapshot before deletion (available for RDS, EBS, and Redshift). **UpdateReplacePolicy** applies the same options but to resource replacement during an update. On creation failure, CloudFormation rolls back and deletes all resources it had already created — use \`--disable-rollback\` during debugging to inspect what was created.`,

Nested stacks share a lifecycle with the parent — when you delete the parent, all nested stacks are deleted too. This tight coupling is the tradeoff compared to **cross-stack references**, which use \`Outputs\` with \`Export\` names and \`!ImportValue\` in other stacks. Cross-stack references have independent lifecycles — stacks can be updated separately — but come with a constraint: you cannot delete a stack whose exports are referenced by another stack.

**Stack Sets** extend deployment to multiple AWS accounts and regions simultaneously. A single Stack Set definition can deploy identical stacks across hundreds of accounts. When integrated with AWS Organizations, Stack Sets can automatically deploy to all existing accounts in an organizational unit and to any new accounts that join — making them ideal for security baselines, compliance guardrails, and landing zone configuration applied across your entire organization.`,

Understanding CloudFormation is therefore foundational even if you use CDK or SAM day-to-day.

Integrating CloudFormation with **CodePipeline** creates a safe infrastructure delivery pipeline: a template change triggers the pipeline, a CloudFormation action creates a change set, a manual approval action reviews it, and a second CloudFormation action executes it. This pattern keeps infrastructure changes auditable and reversible.

**Custom Resources** are the escape hatch for resources or operations that CloudFormation doesn't natively support. A Lambda function receives Create, Update, and Delete events from CloudFormation and must respond to a pre-signed S3 URL with a success or failure signal. This lets you provision non-AWS resources (like DNS records in third-party providers), run database migrations, or perform any custom logic as part of a CloudFormation deployment.
