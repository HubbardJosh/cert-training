  intro:
    "AWS Amplify is a set of tools and services for building full-stack web and mobile applications. It includes Amplify Hosting (CI/CD + CDN for frontend apps), Amplify Studio (visual app builder), and Amplify Libraries (frontend SDK for Auth, API, Storage, Analytics). Amplify provisions and connects AWS services (Cognito, AppSync, S3, DynamoDB) automatically.",

      heading: "Amplify Hosting",
      body: `**Amplify Hosting** is a fully managed CI/CD and hosting platform for web applications. You connect a Git repository — GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, or CodeCommit — and Amplify automatically builds and deploys your app on every push. It supports virtually every major framework including React, Next.js, Vue, Angular, Gatsby, Hugo, and plain HTML.

Build behavior is controlled by an \`amplify.yml\` file at the root of your repository (or Amplify auto-detects the framework and generates sensible defaults). Each Git branch gets its own unique URL automatically — for example, your \`dev\` branch might be at \`dev.d111.amplifyapp.com\` while \`main\` is at \`main.d111.amplifyapp.com\`. Pull requests also get their own preview URLs, making it easy to share staging environments before merging.

Custom domains are fully managed: connect your domain and Amplify automatically provisions an ACM certificate and configures the CloudFront distribution. For Next.js applications, Amplify natively supports server-side rendering. You can also add basic auth password protection to specific branch deployments to restrict staging access. URL redirects, rewrites, and SPA fallback rules are configurable through the Amplify console.`,

import { defineAuth } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

  }).authorization(allow => [allow.owner()]),
});

export const data = defineData({ schema });
\`\`\`

The TypeScript definitions map to real AWS services under the hood: Auth provisions a Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool, Data provisions an AppSync GraphQL API with DynamoDB tables, Storage provisions an S3 bucket, and Functions provision Lambda functions. Amplify Gen 1 used a CLI-based workflow (\`amplify add auth\`, \`amplify add api\`) that generated CloudFormation templates — it's still widely used and you'll see both approaches in production codebases.`,

\`\`\`typescript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import config from './amplifyconfiguration.json';

The Auth category wraps Cognito, providing sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, and token management through a clean API. \`fetchAuthSession()\` retrieves current JWT tokens without forcing you to understand the underlying Cognito flows. The API category wraps AppSync — \`generateClient()\` returns a typed client that infers query and mutation types from your schema, catching type errors at compile time. The Storage category wraps S3 with Cognito Identity Pool credentials for per-user access.

import { signIn, fetchAuthSession } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

The Data category creates an **AppSync GraphQL API** backed by **DynamoDB tables** — one table per model in your schema. Authorization is declared at the schema level using authorization rules that Amplify translates into AppSync resolvers and DynamoDB access patterns:

- \`allow.owner()\` — users can only read and write their own records, identified by a Cognito user ID stored on each item
- \`allow.authenticated()\` — any signed-in user can access the resource
- \`allow.guest()\` — unauthenticated (public) access, using the Identity Pool's unauthenticated role
- \`allow.groups(['Admin'])\` — access restricted to members of a specific Cognito User Pool group
- \`allow.custom()\` — a Lambda authorizer handles the decision

AppSync subscriptions work automatically with the Amplify client — when you perform a mutation, subscribed clients receive real-time updates over WebSocket without any additional configuration. Conflict resolution for offline sync uses optimistic concurrency with version tracking; you can configure per-model handlers for auto-merge, last-writer-wins, or custom Lambda logic.`,

Amplify Hosting uses CloudFront for CDN delivery.

Amplify Functions are Lambda functions that you can use as AppSync resolvers, API Gateway handlers, or Cognito triggers.
