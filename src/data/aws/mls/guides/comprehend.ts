  sections: [
    {
      heading: "Core NLP Capabilities",
      body: `Comprehend's pre-trained NLP APIs analyze text and return structured insights. DetectSentiment classifies text as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL, or MIXED, with confidence scores for each — useful for product review analysis, customer support ticket classification, and social media monitoring. DetectEntities identifies named entities in text and classifies them into types: PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, DATE, QUANTITY, TITLE, and more. This is used to extract structured information from unstructured documents.

DetectKeyPhrases extracts the most important noun phrases from text, supporting document summarization and search indexing pipelines. DetectDominantLanguage identifies the primary language in text, supporting multilingual NLP pipelines that route documents to the appropriate language-specific processing. DetectSyntax performs part-of-speech tagging, returning the grammatical role of each token. These APIs accept plain text up to 100 KB and return JSON with confidence scores for each detected entity or classification.`,

          question:
            "A customer support platform needs to automatically classify incoming support tickets as urgent (negative sentiment, high-priority keywords) vs. routine. Which Comprehend API combination should they use?",

          explanation:
            "DetectSentiment classifies the emotional tone (NEGATIVE for urgent tickets) and DetectKeyPhrases extracts important terms (like 'system down,' 'cannot log in') that indicate priority. Combining these provides a richer signal for urgency classification than either API alone.",
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      heading: "Comprehend Custom Classification and Entity Recognition",
      body: `Comprehend Custom Classification trains a custom text classification model on your labeled documents using transfer learning. You provide training documents with their labels (multi-class or multi-label), and Comprehend automatically trains a model. This is appropriate for domain-specific classification tasks — routing legal documents to practice areas, classifying scientific papers by research domain, or categorizing support tickets by product line — where the pre-trained models don't have the necessary domain knowledge.

Comprehend Custom Entity Recognition trains a custom NER (Named Entity Recognition) model to identify domain-specific entities. For example, a pharmaceutical company could train a model to recognize drug names, dosage forms, and adverse event terms that standard Comprehend entity types don't cover. Training requires annotated text (documents with entity spans marked) or a CSV of entity examples. Both Custom Classification and Custom Entity Recognition deploy as real-time endpoints or run as asynchronous batch jobs via \`StartDocumentClassificationJob\`.`,

        {
          question:

    {
      heading: "Comprehend Topic Modeling",
      body: `Comprehend Topic Modeling uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover abstract topics that occur in a collection of documents without labeled training data. It is an unsupervised technique that identifies co-occurring word patterns and groups them into topics. For example, analyzing a corpus of news articles might discover topics like {election, vote, candidate, poll} and {stock, market, earnings, revenue} without you specifying what the topics are.

Topic modeling via Comprehend runs as an asynchronous job: you provide an S3 bucket with input documents and a target S3 location for results. Comprehend returns a \`topic-terms.csv\` mapping topics to their most representative terms and a \`doc-topics.csv\` showing the topic mixture for each document. This is useful for EDA on large document corpora before building supervised classifiers — you discover the natural topic structure, then use that to guide label design for Custom Classification.`,

      heading: "Comprehend Medical and Comprehend for Healthcare",
      body: `Amazon Comprehend Medical is a specialized version of Comprehend trained on clinical and medical text. It extracts medical entities including medical conditions, medications, dosages, tests, and procedures from clinical notes, discharge summaries, and electronic health records. It also identifies PHI (Protected Health Information) entities — patient names, dates, ages, contact information — supporting HIPAA-compliant de-identification pipelines.

InferICD10CM maps detected medical conditions to ICD-10-CM codes (diagnosis codes used in medical billing). InferRxNorm maps medications to RxNorm codes (standard medication identifiers). InferSNOMEDCT maps to SNOMED CT clinical terminology. These medical code inference APIs transform unstructured clinical text into structured, codified medical records suitable for population health analytics and clinical NLP training datasets. Comprehend Medical does not require ML expertise and can process clinical text at scale as a batch job.`,

      heading: "Comprehend Integration and Batch Processing",
      body: `For large-scale text analysis, Comprehend supports asynchronous batch jobs that process S3 input files and write results to S3 output. Batch jobs support all core NLP operations and run on Comprehend's managed infrastructure without requiring instance provisioning. This model is appropriate for processing millions of documents — product reviews, support tickets, legal filings — that need NLP analysis before building ML training datasets or generating business intelligence.

Comprehend integrates naturally with the broader AWS data pipeline. S3 stores documents, Comprehend processes them, results land in S3 in JSON or CSV format, Glue or Athena queries the results, and processed features flow to SageMaker for downstream ML. Lambda can orchestrate real-time single-document analysis: an API Gateway endpoint receives text, Lambda calls Comprehend synchronously, and returns the sentiment and entities in the API response. For compliance, Comprehend supports VPC endpoints and KMS encryption of result files.`,
