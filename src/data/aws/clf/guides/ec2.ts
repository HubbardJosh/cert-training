      body: `Amazon EC2 is the foundation of AWS compute. It provides **virtual machines** (called instances) that you can launch within minutes, configure as you need, and terminate when done. Instead of purchasing physical servers, you rent compute capacity by the hour or second, paying only for what you use.

Each EC2 instance runs on physical hardware inside an AWS data center, but you interact with it as if it were your own dedicated machine. You choose the **operating system** (Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Windows Server, and many others), install your software, and control network access through security groups and VPC settings.`,

**General Purpose** (M and T families) balance compute, memory, and networking — ideal for web servers, small databases, and development environments. The T family uses **burstable performance**, accumulating CPU credits during idle periods and spending them during spikes.

**Compute Optimized** (C family) offer a higher ratio of CPU to memory, suited for batch processing, high-traffic web servers, and scientific modeling. **Memory Optimized** (R, X families) provide large amounts of RAM for in-memory databases and real-time analytics. **Storage Optimized** (I, D families) deliver high sequential read/write throughput for NoSQL databases and data warehouses.

For the Cloud Practitioner exam, the key concept is that you pick an instance type to match your workload rather than over-provisioning an expensive type for a simple task.`,

**On-Demand** instances have no upfront cost and no long-term commitment. You pay per second (or hour) of running time. This is the default and most flexible option, best for unpredictable or short-lived workloads.

**Reserved Instances** (RIs) commit you to one or three years in exchange for discounts of up to 72% compared to On-Demand. You choose a specific instance type and region. Standard RIs are cheapest but inflexible; Convertible RIs allow you to change the instance family if your needs evolve.

**Savings Plans** are a flexible alternative to RIs. You commit to a minimum amount of compute spend per hour (e.g., $10/hr) for one or three years, and AWS applies discounts automatically across multiple services including Lambda and Fargate.

**Spot Instances** let you bid for spare EC2 capacity at discounts up to 90%. AWS can reclaim Spot instances with a two-minute warning, making them ideal for fault-tolerant batch jobs, big data processing, or stateless web tiers that can handle interruption.

**Dedicated Hosts** provide a physical server entirely for your use, which is required for software licenses tied to physical cores or sockets, or for compliance requirements that prohibit shared hardware.`,

Instance store is physically attached to the host hardware, delivering very high throughput and low latency. However, instance store data is **ephemeral** — it disappears when the instance stops or terminates. Use instance store only for temporary data like caches or scratch space.

**Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)** provides network-attached, persistent block storage. EBS volumes survive instance stops and terminations (unless you configure them to delete on termination). You can take **EBS snapshots** to back up a volume to S3 at any point. EBS volumes come in types including \`gp3\` (general-purpose SSD), \`io2\` (high-performance SSD for databases), and \`st1\` (throughput-optimized HDD for streaming workloads).

Access to a Linux instance is typically via **SSH** using a **key pair**: AWS stores the public key and you keep the private key file (\`.pem\`). Windows instances use **RDP** and a password you decrypt with your private key.

EC2 instances can be assigned an **IAM Instance Profile**, which grants the instance an IAM role. This is the secure way to give your application running on EC2 access to other AWS services (like reading from S3 or writing to DynamoDB) without embedding credentials in code.
