      body: `Many organizations have fleets of on-premises cameras — factory floor cameras monitoring assembly lines, retail cameras tracking foot traffic, warehouse cameras watching conveyor belts — where they want to apply computer vision to detect defects, count people, identify safety violations, or measure operational metrics. The naive approach is streaming all video to the cloud for analysis, but this creates multiple problems: high bandwidth costs, latency (cloud round-trips take hundreds of milliseconds), and data privacy concerns around continuously streaming video of employees and customers to remote servers.

AWS Panorama solves this by bringing ML inference to the camera. Models are deployed to on-premises hardware that connects to local cameras, processes video frames locally, and sends only inference results (not raw video) to the cloud. This reduces bandwidth dramatically, reduces latency to milliseconds, and keeps sensitive video data on-premises.`,

Panorama is distinct from Rekognition (cloud-based, works on images/video already in AWS) and SageMaker (model training and cloud-based inference). The key differentiator is **edge deployment to existing cameras** — you do not need to replace your camera infrastructure, and your video stays on-premises.
