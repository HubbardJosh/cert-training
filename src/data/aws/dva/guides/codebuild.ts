  intro:
    "CodeBuild is a fully managed continuous integration service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces deployable artifacts. There are no servers to provision or maintain — CodeBuild scales automatically and you pay per build minute. It integrates with CodePipeline, GitHub Actions, and ECR for Docker builds.",

      heading: "How CodeBuild Works",
      body: `A **build project** is the configuration that tells CodeBuild how to run a build. It specifies where your source code lives (CodeCommit, GitHub, Bitbucket, or S3), which compute environment to use, where your buildspec lives, where to put build artifacts, and what IAM role the build runs as. When you trigger a **build run**, CodeBuild starts a fresh container, fetches your source, executes the buildspec, and terminates — leaving no persistent state between runs.

Billing is per build minute, based on the compute type you select. Build types range from small (3 GB RAM, 2 vCPU) through medium (7 GB) and large (15 GB) to extra-large configurations for compute-intensive workloads, as well as ARM-based options. Since each build starts a new container and you're billed only while it runs, there are no idle costs — a significant advantage over maintaining dedicated build servers.

Multiple builds can run concurrently by default. CodeBuild scales automatically to handle parallel builds from multiple developers or pipeline stages. You can configure concurrency limits per project or per account to prevent runaway build costs.`,

When you need a tool or runtime version not available in managed images, you can specify a custom Docker image from ECR or Docker Hub and CodeBuild will use it as the build environment.

**Docker builds** require a special consideration: to run the Docker daemon inside a CodeBuild container (Docker-in-Docker), you must enable **privileged mode** in the build project's environment settings. Without privileged mode, Docker commands will fail. The CodeBuild service role needs ECR permissions to pull your base images and push built images.

Environment variables can be set at three levels: **plaintext** variables embedded in the project or buildspec (visible in the console — never use for secrets), **SSM Parameter Store** references (fetched securely at build time), and **Secrets Manager** references (also fetched at build time). CodePipeline can also pass variables to CodeBuild actions, enabling dynamic per-execution configuration.

You define which files to include in the artifacts section of your buildspec, and CodeBuild uploads them to S3 on success. The \`base-directory\` setting lets you specify a subdirectory as the artifact root so you don't accidentally include source files in the output. You can also configure **secondary artifacts** to produce multiple distinct output packages from a single build run — useful for producing a test report alongside the deployment package.

**Caching** dramatically reduces build times by preserving dependency directories between builds. S3 caching uploads your \`node_modules\` or \`~/.m2\` directory to S3 at the end of a build and downloads it at the start of the next — slower because it crosses the network, but persistent across different build hosts. Local caching is faster but only works when the same build host is reused across sequential builds.

**Test reports** give you a visual view of test results in the CodeBuild console. If your test framework produces JUnit XML output, configure CodeBuild to collect it and you get pass/fail counts, trend charts, and individual test durations over time — without needing a separate test reporting tool.`,

CodeBuild creates ENIs in your subnets for the duration of the build.

The **service role** is the IAM role that CodeBuild assumes during the build. It needs permissions for everything the build does: S3 (to read source and write artifacts), CloudWatch Logs (to stream build output), ECR (to pull base images and push built images), and any other AWS service the build interacts with. Secrets Manager and SSM permissions are needed if the buildspec references secrets or parameters. Use least-privilege principles — only grant the permissions actually needed.

Storing secrets as plaintext environment variables is a common mistake. They're visible in the CodeBuild console and in CloudWatch Logs output. Instead, always reference secrets through \`env.secrets-manager\` or \`env.parameter-store\` in the buildspec, which fetches them at build time and doesn't expose the values in logs.

**CodeBuild + ECR** is the standard pattern for containerized applications. The build compiles code, runs tests, builds a Docker image, and pushes it to ECR — all in one build run. The \`docker push\` command uses the CodeBuild service role's ECR permissions, so no separate credentials management is needed.

**CodeBuild + GitHub** via CodeStar connections or OAuth enables builds triggered by pull requests. This lets you run tests automatically on every PR, blocking merges if tests fail. Build status is reported back to GitHub's PR interface.

All CodeBuild build output is streamed to **CloudWatch Logs** in real time. Each build project gets its own log group, and each build run gets its own log stream.
