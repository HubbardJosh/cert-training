      heading: "What Is Amazon RDS?",
      body: `Amazon RDS is a **managed database service** that handles the undifferentiated heavy lifting of running a relational database: provisioning hardware, installing database software, taking backups, applying patches, and monitoring health. You choose a database engine and instance size, and RDS handles the rest.

RDS supports seven popular database engines: **Amazon Aurora** (MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible, AWS-built), **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **MariaDB**, **Oracle Database**, **Microsoft SQL Server**, and **IBM Db2**. For the Cloud Practitioner exam, knowing these engines exist is sufficient — you do not need to know their internal differences deeply.

The key benefit of RDS over running your own database on EC2 is that AWS manages the operational burden. You still control the schema, queries, and application logic, but AWS handles the infrastructure layer.`,

If the primary instance fails — due to hardware failure, an AZ outage, or a maintenance event — RDS automatically fails over to the standby. The failover typically completes in **60–120 seconds**. Your application reconnects to the same DNS endpoint (RDS provides a single DNS hostname), so no code changes are required.

Multi-AZ is about **availability and durability**, not performance. The standby instance does not serve read traffic. If you want to scale read traffic, you use Read Replicas instead. Multi-AZ and Read Replicas can be used together.`,

Because replication is asynchronous, there may be slight lag between the primary and replica — this is called **replication lag**.

You can create Read Replicas in the same region, a different region, or even a different AWS account. Cross-region Read Replicas are useful for serving read traffic closer to global users or for disaster recovery.

RDS supports up to **15 Read Replicas** per primary instance for MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL. Aurora supports up to 15 Aurora Replicas. Your application connects to separate endpoints: the primary endpoint for writes, and replica endpoints for reads.

A Read Replica can be promoted to become an independent primary database, which is useful for disaster recovery scenarios or for creating a new production database from an existing one.`,

**Automated backups** are enabled by default and run daily during a configurable backup window. RDS backs up the entire database instance and transaction logs, allowing **point-in-time recovery** to any second within the retention period (1 to 35 days). These backups are stored in S3 and are deleted when you delete the RDS instance.

**Manual snapshots** are user-initiated backups that persist until you explicitly delete them. Use snapshots before major changes, for long-term archival, or to copy a database to another region.

You can **restore** from either backup type, but this always creates a **new** RDS instance — you cannot restore in place. After restoration, you update your application's connection string to point to the new instance.

**Encryption at rest** is configured when you create the instance using AWS KMS. An encrypted instance has its storage, automated backups, read replicas, and snapshots all encrypted. You cannot enable encryption on an existing unencrypted instance — you must create a snapshot, copy it with encryption enabled, and restore from the encrypted snapshot.`,
