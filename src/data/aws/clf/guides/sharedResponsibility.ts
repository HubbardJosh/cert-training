  intro:
    "The AWS Shared Responsibility Model defines the division of security responsibilities between AWS and the customer — AWS is responsible for security OF the cloud (the infrastructure), while customers are responsible for security IN the cloud (their data, applications, and configurations).",

      heading: "The Core Concept",
      body: `Security and compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer. This distinction is fundamental to understanding cloud security and is a central topic on the Cloud Practitioner exam.

**AWS is responsible for security OF the cloud** — the physical data centers, the hardware (servers, networking equipment, storage), the hypervisor that powers virtualization, and the managed service infrastructure that AWS operates. AWS secures the global infrastructure that runs all AWS services. Customers never need to worry about physical data center security, hardware failures, or the security of the AWS network.

**Customers are responsible for security IN the cloud** — everything they build and configure on top of the AWS infrastructure. This includes operating systems on EC2 instances, applications, data stored in AWS, network configuration (VPC, security groups, NACLs), IAM user and permission management, and encryption configuration.

The dividing line shifts depending on which AWS services you use, which is why understanding the model by service type is important.`,

The customer is responsible for: what data they store, database user permissions (grants), encryption settings, security group rules controlling network access, and ensuring the database schema and queries are secure.

**For DynamoDB and S3** (fully managed services), AWS manages essentially everything below the data level: hardware, OS, service software, availability, and redundancy. The customer is responsible for: data itself, IAM policies controlling access, encryption configuration (client-side or server-side), S3 bucket policies, and ensuring Block Public Access is correctly configured.

**For Lambda**, AWS manages the compute infrastructure, the runtime environment, and automatic scaling. The customer is responsible for: the function code, the IAM execution role and its permissions, environment variables and secrets management, and the business logic that processes event data.

The general principle: the more managed a service is, the less infrastructure responsibility the customer has, but data and access control always remain the customer's responsibility.`,

**AWS Inherited Controls** are controls that customers fully inherit from AWS. Customers do not need to implement or verify these. Examples include physical and environmental controls (data center security, temperature, fire suppression), hardware lifecycle management, and the security of the AWS global network.

**Shared Controls** are responsibilities that apply to both the infrastructure layer and the customer layer, but in separate contexts. **Patch management** is shared: AWS patches the infrastructure, hypervisors, and managed service software; customers patch their EC2 operating systems and application dependencies. **Configuration management** is shared: AWS configures the infrastructure; customers configure their resources, security groups, and IAM policies. **Awareness and training** is shared: AWS trains its employees; customers train their own employees.

**Customer Specific Controls** are entirely the customer's responsibility, such as data encryption (choosing to encrypt at rest and in transit), data integrity authentication, and defining the acceptable use policies for their applications.`,

      heading: "Practical Implications",
      body: `Understanding the Shared Responsibility Model has direct practical implications for how you secure your AWS workloads.

You must **patch your EC2 operating systems**. AWS does not do this. Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to automate patching across your EC2 fleet. For managed services like RDS, AWS handles patching, but you must schedule the maintenance window appropriately.

You are responsible for **configuring security groups correctly**. An overly permissive security group (allowing SSH from 0.0.0.0/0) is entirely the customer's fault and responsibility to fix. Trusted Advisor's security checks help identify these misconfigurations.

**Encryption is the customer's choice**. AWS provides the tools (KMS, server-side encryption, TLS) but enabling them is the customer's responsibility. Encrypting data at rest and in transit is a customer obligation under most compliance frameworks.

**IAM is entirely the customer's domain**. Creating root account access keys, not enabling MFA, or granting overly broad IAM permissions are all customer mistakes. AWS provides the tools and best practice guidance, but the customer controls IAM configuration.

For the exam, the most tested concept is: **AWS secures the physical infrastructure and hardware; customers secure their data, OS, network configuration, and IAM.** When in doubt, ask "is this the cloud infrastructure itself, or is it what runs on top?"`,
