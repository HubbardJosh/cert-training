      body: `Traditional enterprise search — keyword-based search over file shares, intranets, and document repositories — returns a list of documents ranked by keyword frequency. Employees must read through results to find the actual answer. Amazon Kendra takes a fundamentally different approach: it understands the natural language meaning of a query and returns a direct answer extracted from indexed documents, along with the source document for verification.

Kendra is designed for the enterprise search use case: customer service agents finding product information, employees searching internal wikis and HR policies, researchers navigating large document libraries, and developers searching technical documentation. It understands synonyms, acronyms, and domain-specific terminology, and it can answer questions phrased naturally ("What is the return policy for electronics?") rather than requiring keyword matching ("return policy electronics").`,

You create an Index, configure data sources, and Kendra crawls and indexes the content automatically on a schedule.

Built-in connectors support Amazon S3, SharePoint Online, Confluence, Salesforce, ServiceNow, RDS databases, OneDrive, Google Drive, GitHub, Box, Slack, Quip, and more. Each connector handles authentication, crawling, and incremental updates, so your index stays current without manual re-ingestion. You can also use the **BatchPutDocument** API to push documents directly into the index from custom sources.

Documents can include metadata **attributes** — tags like document type, department, author, date, and access control lists — that enable faceted filtering and fine-grained permissions at query time.`,

In a RAG architecture, a user's question is first sent to a retrieval system that finds relevant document passages, then those passages are injected into the prompt of a language model to produce a grounded, accurate answer.

Kendra is well-suited for the retrieval step because it understands natural language queries and ranks results by semantic relevance rather than keyword overlap. Kendra can be integrated into RAG pipelines with Amazon Bedrock via a custom Lambda retrieval step — your Lambda function queries Kendra, retrieves the most relevant passages, and passes them to the Bedrock model as context. Note that Kendra is NOT a natively supported vector store within Bedrock Knowledge Bases (which supports OpenSearch Serverless, Aurora pgvector, Pinecone, Redis Enterprise, and MongoDB Atlas); integrating Kendra with Bedrock requires custom application code.
