    "Serverless ETL and data catalog service for preparing ML training data at scale",
  intro:
    "AWS Glue is the primary serverless ETL service used in ML pipelines for transforming raw data into training-ready datasets. It combines a managed Apache Spark environment for large-scale data processing with a centralized Data Catalog that makes datasets discoverable across AWS services.",

  sections: [
    {
      heading: "AWS Glue Data Catalog",
      body: `The Glue Data Catalog is a centralized metadata repository that stores table definitions, schema information, and partition metadata for datasets stored in S3, RDS, Redshift, and other data sources. It is compatible with the Apache Hive Metastore, meaning services like Amazon Athena, Amazon EMR, and Amazon Redshift Spectrum can all query the same catalog without duplicate schema definitions. For ML workflows, the Data Catalog makes raw and processed datasets discoverable across teams without sharing S3 bucket paths directly.

Glue Crawlers automatically scan data sources, infer schemas, and populate the Data Catalog. Crawlers can run on a schedule to detect new partitions or schema changes. In an ML pipeline, you might run a crawler after daily data ingestion to make the new partition available to Athena for exploratory queries and to SageMaker Processing for feature engineering. The catalog integrates with Lake Formation for fine-grained access control.`,

          explanation:
            "The Glue Data Catalog is a metadata repository — it stores schemas and partition info, not the data itself. It makes S3 datasets queryable by Athena, EMR, and other services without duplicating schema definitions. Crawlers populate it automatically by scanning data sources.",

    },
    {
      heading: "Glue ETL Jobs for ML Data Preparation",
      body: `Glue ETL Jobs run on a managed Apache Spark cluster and support Python (PySpark) and Scala. You define transformation logic in a script, specify input/output data sources, and Glue provisions the Spark cluster, runs the job, and terminates the cluster. This serverless model means there are no clusters to manage. For ML feature engineering, Glue ETL jobs handle operations like joining tables from different sources, pivoting data, computing aggregates, and writing output in Parquet format optimized for training.

Glue DynamicFrame is Glue's extension of the Spark DataFrame that handles semi-structured, messy, or schema-inconsistent data more gracefully — it tolerates nested structures and type inconsistencies that would cause Spark DataFrames to fail. For ML pipelines that ingest messy real-world data (logs, clickstreams, IoT events), DynamicFrames allow processing to continue even when records don't conform to a rigid schema. Glue jobs can write output directly to S3 in Parquet or ORC format, which are the optimal formats for SageMaker Training Jobs.`,

      heading: "Glue DataBrew for No-Code Data Preparation",
      body: `AWS Glue DataBrew is a visual data preparation tool designed for analysts who need to clean and normalize datasets without writing code. It provides over 250 pre-built transformations including handling missing values, removing duplicates, normalizing formats, and encoding categoricals. DataBrew profiles datasets to show statistics like missing value counts, outlier distributions, and cardinality, which directly supports the data quality assessment phase of ML projects.

DataBrew integrates with the Glue Data Catalog, S3, Redshift, and other sources. Recipes (sequences of transformations) are versioned and can be applied to new data as it arrives, supporting repeatable preprocessing. While SageMaker Data Wrangler serves a similar purpose within the SageMaker ecosystem, DataBrew is broader and works across data engineering teams that may not use SageMaker. For the MLS-C01 exam, know that DataBrew is a no-code data prep tool complementary to Glue ETL.`,

      heading: "Glue Streaming and Real-Time Feature Engineering",
      body: `AWS Glue Streaming ETL processes data from Kinesis Data Streams and Kafka in near real-time using a continuously running Spark Structured Streaming job. This is relevant for ML use cases that require features computed from streaming data, such as fraud detection models that need features derived from the last 10 minutes of transaction activity or recommendation systems needing real-time click-stream features.

Glue Streaming jobs output to S3, Kinesis Data Firehose, or direct to SageMaker Feature Store using the FeatureStore ingest API, enabling near-real-time feature materialization into the online store. The architecture for real-time ML typically combines Kinesis Data Streams (event ingestion) → Glue Streaming (feature computation) → SageMaker Feature Store Online Store (low-latency feature retrieval for inference). This pattern avoids the staleness problem in online inference where pre-computed batch features lag behind real-world events.`,

This is the canonical real-time feature engineering pattern.",

      heading: "Glue in the ML Pipeline Architecture",
      body: `In a complete ML pipeline, Glue occupies the data engineering layer between raw data sources and ML training. The typical flow is: raw data lands in an S3 landing zone → Glue Crawlers catalog it → Glue ETL Jobs transform and clean it → processed data written to S3 in Parquet format → SageMaker Training Jobs consume it. This clear separation of concerns means data engineers own the Glue layer and ML engineers own the SageMaker layer, with S3 and the Glue Data Catalog serving as the handoff point.

Glue integrates with AWS Lake Formation for centralized access control on the Data Catalog and S3 data. In regulated environments, Lake Formation column-level and row-level permissions ensure ML engineers only access authorized columns of training data. Glue also supports connections to JDBC sources (RDS, Redshift, on-premises databases), enabling ML pipelines to train on data residing outside S3 without manual data movement.`,
