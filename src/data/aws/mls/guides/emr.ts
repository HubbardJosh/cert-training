  intro:
    "Amazon EMR is the AWS managed big data platform for running Apache Spark, Hadoop, Hive, HBase, Presto, and other open-source frameworks on scalable EC2 clusters. For ML, EMR handles large-scale feature engineering, distributed model training with Spark MLlib, and EDA on datasets too large for single-node processing.",

      heading: "EMR Architecture and Cluster Types",
      body: `An EMR cluster consists of a primary node (coordinates the cluster, runs the resource manager), core nodes (run tasks and store data in HDFS), and optional task nodes (add compute without HDFS storage). For ML workloads, using EMR with S3 as the data store (instead of HDFS) and task nodes as Spot Instances provides the best cost-performance balance — Spot task nodes add cheap compute for Spark jobs, and data persists in S3 even if Spot Instances are reclaimed.

EMR supports two deployment modes: long-running clusters (appropriate for interactive Spark sessions using EMR Studio or Jupyter notebooks for data exploration) and transient clusters (spin up, run a job, terminate — optimal for automated ML pipeline steps). Transient clusters with Spot task nodes and S3 storage are the cost-efficient architecture for ML feature engineering pipelines that run on a schedule. EMR Auto Scaling adjusts core and task node counts based on YARN queue depth or custom CloudWatch metrics.`,

      heading: "Apache Spark on EMR for ML Feature Engineering",
      body: `Apache Spark is the most widely used framework on EMR for ML data preparation. Spark's distributed DataFrame API allows data engineers to apply transformations across hundreds of nodes concurrently, enabling feature engineering on terabyte-scale datasets. Typical ML feature engineering operations in Spark include joining behavioral and transactional datasets, computing user-level aggregations (average session duration, lifetime spend), one-hot encoding categoricals, scaling numerics, and writing Parquet output to S3 for SageMaker consumption.

Spark MLlib extends the Spark API with distributed ML algorithms including linear regression, random forests, gradient-boosted trees, k-means clustering, PCA, and TF-IDF vectorization. While SageMaker's built-in algorithms or custom models are typically used for production training, Spark MLlib is valuable for rapid prototyping, baseline model building on large datasets, and feature extraction pipelines that produce embeddings. EMR also supports SparkR and PySpark in EMR Studio notebooks for interactive EDA.`,

      body: `EMR integrates natively with the AWS Glue Data Catalog as its Hive Metastore replacement. When configured to use the Glue catalog, Spark and Hive jobs on EMR can query tables defined by Glue Crawlers without redefining schemas. This shared catalog means data engineered by Glue ETL jobs and cataloged by Glue Crawlers is immediately available to EMR Spark jobs for further processing — and both can be queried by Athena using the same table definitions.

This catalog integration is architecturally important for ML pipelines because it creates a single schema definition used across all services. When a Glue ETL job produces a processed Parquet dataset and catalogs it, an EMR Spark job can immediately read it using Spark SQL without writing S3 paths or schema definitions in code. Lake Formation permissions control which EMR roles can access which catalog tables and columns, enabling column-level access control on ML training data.`,

      body: `EMR clusters for ML should always run in a VPC private subnet to prevent public internet exposure of training data. Security groups control inbound/outbound traffic — the primary node and core nodes require specific ports for Spark, YARN, HDFS, and SSH communication. EMR encryption covers data in transit (TLS between nodes and to S3) and data at rest (HDFS local disk encryption using LUKS, S3 encryption via SSE-KMS).

IAM roles for EMR include the EMR service role (grants EMR permission to create EC2 resources), the EC2 instance profile (grants cluster nodes access to S3, Glue, DynamoDB, and other services), and optionally Lake Formation permissions for catalog access. For regulated ML workloads, Kerberos authentication can be enabled for cluster node-to-node communication. EMR also supports Apache Ranger for fine-grained authorization on Hive and Spark SQL queries, controlling which users can access which columns in training datasets.`,

      heading: "EMR vs Glue for ML Data Processing",
      body: `Choosing between EMR and Glue for ML data processing depends on complexity, control, and cost. Glue is serverless — no cluster management, automatic scaling, and a pay-per-DPU-second model. Glue is appropriate for most standard ETL tasks: joining tables, converting formats, applying transformations, and loading to destinations. It is the default choice for teams that want managed infrastructure and are not running workloads that require Spark customization.

EMR is appropriate when you need control over Spark configuration (custom Spark settings, specific library versions, native libraries), need to run frameworks unavailable in Glue (HBase, Presto, Flink on YARN), or are running interactive data science workflows in EMR Studio notebooks. EMR per-node pricing can be more cost-effective than Glue for very large, long-running jobs. For the MLS-C01 exam, know that Glue is the managed ETL default and EMR is for complex, customizable, or interactive big data workloads.`,
